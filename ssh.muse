
** SSH keys **

 1. on my laptop as common user peter
 <example>
 $ ssh-keygen -t dsa
 </example>
 then i shall have in /home/peter/.ssh a pair of keys   (public key: id_dsa and private key: id_dsa.pub)

 1. now on romi
 <example>
 #mkdir peter/.ssh
 </example>
 copy my public key here with the name authorized_keys

 1. now I can login romi safer with my ssh keysd
 
 //login for the first time I need to type 111111 to active to key
 
 //but if I need to login in other machines I still need the former passwd: peter1983

 1. when I reinstall my local OS, I need to do the above 3 step again.

 but when I am trying to copy sth form romi to my local machine, I see warning related to romi: ./ssh/knownhost

 the solution is simply deleting this file, it will be created again automatically
