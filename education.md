## The Goal of the Education
To teach the kid to be Confucius-like gentleman who is willing to make a difference, and let him learn science and technology so that he is able to do it, like Elon Musk.

## terms
- A Learning Target 
    - Learning targets are concrete goals written in student-friendly language that clearly describe what students will learn and be able to do by the end of a given hours of learning( through a learning unit, project, or even course). They begin with an “I can” statement, which meaning each target is a skill.The final examation will be foucsed on the mastery of the skill.  
- A Course
  - a course is a set of small Learning Target serving a large Learning Target
- A Learning Hour
  - a course's length is meatureed by how many hours of learning
  - a leaning hour is 50 mins learning and 10min relaxation
- A Art
  - A very general but imporant and long-term(5 or 10 years) skill, e.g speaking English or coding
  - The whole teaching will be lead by 6 Arts, which gave me the direction to design courses
- A Exam
  - given at the end of each Learning Target and Course, mark will be A, B, C
  - e.g 'writing a essay on certain topic with 3hr', 'building a stool with 1 day'
- A Learing Log
  - Recording every learning hour
  - format '13:00pm-14:00pm Learning Targets, some side note'

## The Kid's Info
- Elon, name of the kid, was born in Augest 9th 2018
- Boy

## Home Rules
- Food Schedule
  - No cal between meals, no candy/bread/beans/... tomatos and fruits are OK
  - candy in two cases:
    - meal time right after main food.
    - when we go outside.

## Guidelines
- Skill or Porject Oriented Learning
  - With Google at hand, there is no point to do knowledage-oriented learning
  - If Elon learns to calculate 1+1, that is a skill
    - If Elon knows how to boil a egg, that could be a skill or a project
  - Learn from these Youtubers, can upload a video once Elon master the skill

- First Principles Teaching
  - Train the kid to be a maker
  - skill-based course design
    - what do I mean by 'skill-based courses'
      - 'speaking English', 'playing go' or 'writing a essay' are clearly skills
      - some school courses are not skill based, say Geography or Biology, which are also very useful, then how does these 'knowledge-based courses' fit into my plan. I will turn them into skill-based scheme, for example, after 100 hours of Biology learning, the Elon would be to 'do a video to explain clearly how food are degested', now 'doing a video to explain sth' is a skill. 'being logically clear' is a metric for the learning result.

  - "Education is but downloading data and algorithm to your brain. If you want to teach a student about something, you'd better first explain why you need to teach them these things. I believe it helps a lot with students' motivation."
  - "I created a little school"
  - The regular schools do not follow 2 principles
    - "One principle: Different kids, differnt interests"
      - so No grades
      - kids learn at their own pace
    - "Second principle: Teach the Problems, not the tools "
      - "Teach problem solving, not the tools"
      - "Say, we want to teach kids about how engines work"
        - "more traditional approch will be first teach how screwdrivers, wrenches work"
        - "you will have a course for screwdrivers, and one for wrenches"
        - "the right approach should be, hey, there is a engine, how to take it apart, oh, we need a screwdriver"
        - "the relevance of the tools become apparent"
