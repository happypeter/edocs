- Elon Musk's School
  - "I created a little school"
  - The regular schools do not follow 2 principles
    - "One principle: Different kids, differnt interests"
      - so No grades
      - kids learn at their own pace
    - "Second principle: Teach the Problems, not the tools "
      - "Teach problem solving, not the tools"
      - "Say, we want to teach kids about how engines work"
        - "more traditional approch will be first teach how screwdrivers, wrenches work"
        - "you will have a course for screwdrivers, and one for wrenches"
        - "the right approach should be, hey, there is a engine, how to take it apart, oh, we need a screwdriver"
        - "the relevance of the tools become apparent"
