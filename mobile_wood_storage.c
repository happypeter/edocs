- top of the shelf will be a flat workspace for tmp storage of anything
  - https://youtu.be/_0H71D7dSDQ?t=712
- a cart like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0H71D7dSDQ
  - I plan to put big board scrap on the floor, so I don't need the angles here
  - for small boards, have a back box like this https://youtu.be/vYu9pn3r5NM?t=170
  - no angles version https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYu9pn3r5NM
  - when I work, I don't really have time to put all cut-offs away
    - so I need a shallow, tmp storage
- wood storage general plan
  - most lumbers/cut-off needs to stay outside
    - since main workshop is small
  - but I still need a place for 
    - trash
    - working-on pieces
    - litte scrap, I want to keep
- do u want a cart? or boxes on a shelf?
  - being on a shelf is nice, since it makes the floor easy to clean
    - but will I left the floor empty?
      - 100% not, because agin my space is limited
      - it's very likely I will put some boxes on the floor under the shelf
        - if the boxes have no casters, that's means to floor is hard to clean 
        - if I want casters, why not build a shelf on casters?
          - so that is a cart!
- so I want a cart, above the cart, I can still do shelves, for lumber or anything
- for future useful cut-offs, you stack them, not bury them in trash
