   * the design for pool table is over kill, I dont think I need shoulders on stretchers https://happypeter.github.io/githome/imgs/20241015/1.jpeg
   * next build, I will have a streight strecher, and fine tune table saw to cut proper notches to fit strecher width
   * and another lesson is, trying not to cut notches, staying stupid with braces for shear force can save 90% of the building time
   * next time, ask myself do I really need a braceless structure? if the answer is no, just stay with butt joint and braces
