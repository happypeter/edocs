## Why Code rather than markdown?
- the Internet never lacks good ideas, over the years, I find myself pasting too many good ideas in each topic markdown file, next time I open the file, I got lost.
- so the idea of code, is to have a workable process to make sth happen, sure I can still paste youtube links in the comments, but that behavoir is intentionally made uncomfortable, if I think the idea is great, implement it with the code.
