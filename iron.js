  - should I buy one just for stickWelding or allInOne?

    - you can buy machine than does both MIG and Stick 
      - PDD: 不用气的二保焊机
    - I will first rule out all methods with GasProtection
      - hard to buy the gas
      - but I do want a machine that works with wider range of thickness
        - even though without Gas, the result will be uglier, even you use thin wire(the MIG-ish way)
