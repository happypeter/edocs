title: My new home office setup
---

- camera
  - follow 董买买's strategy
- Table
  - I don't like the iron leg sharp edge desks now
  - I want wood workbench like my dinning table now
    - round corner, light, legs removable, so very portable

- Add a bit Unix Wisdom to the rooms
  - say consider each container as a folder, and tag names to it. e.g misc/ clothes/underwear/...

- color
  - all big items will be default to black/white/gray and a theme color
    - by gray, I mean really black mixed with white color, no other colors
      - e.g https://youtu.be/Y9_ETrAR6BA?t=319 the sofa
    - I will be very picky with the colorwhen I have to buy somethings that is not black or white
  - every thing will be default to simple IKEA style design
  - theme color
    - use whatever color the roomdoors/closets of the apartment aleady have as theme color
    - people use some gray color as theme which looks really elegent

  - should I use theme color for a curtain, or can can I use black? Need to check some videos of house design
    - dark gray curtain looks great http://qinhuangdao.jiwu.com/info/6416306.html
  - need to train myself to be a pro house painter
  - it does not hurt to have brown color(as what most apartments tend to use for doors in Qinhuangdao)
    - as shown here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9_ETrAR6BA

- rooms
  - I want a study room for myself
    - a single bed is enough for me.  
    - II want a small desk and chair in my room in case I need to work in my own room
  - a double bed in master bedroom for Elon and Billie
  - living room will be the main office
    - a bookshelf between my bench and Billie's to give a little privacy
