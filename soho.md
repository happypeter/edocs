title: My new home office design and implementation
---

NOTE: limit the indentation to 3 levels.

## Design Guidelines
- goal: My own flavor of Nordic/Scandi Style: Minimun+Simplicity+Functionality(from Nordic)+Portable+Modular+Techy(from Myself)
  - minimum. Things(items/shapes/curves/colors) should not exist if they do not add up aesthetic or functional value. Prefer single color items like chairs, plates etc.
  - Simplicity. Limit the details https://youtu.be/2A7kjGzICA8?t=107 'when you have just 5 colors in your home, that feels more peaceful'.
  - functionality. simpler things are often more versatile。 you will be able to reuse them when upgrade your home over time, say, a simple table will be easily use for other purpose, a desk with lots of details won't fit in your new home. Expose kitchen to living room, expose kitchen items for easy pickup, because of the minimum you can still control visual clutter.
  - portable
    - no damage to the walls
    - all the furniture parts should be easily to carry by myself
  - modular
    - furnatures should be very modular and extensible, easy to be replaced and upgraded on part each time
  - techy
    - have posters of github/google/code/editors , the theme is Coder's Home.
    - Unix Filesystem like org. say consider each container as a folder(a box), and tag names to it. e.g misc/ clothes/underwear/... have a beautiful filesystem hirachey so that things are easy to find. everything should have its home. everything is a box. folder should have walls(could be wall/table/phisical-box/thin-air), so that rooms won't look clustered.
- What is Nordic Style?
  - Why so white? because of the long winter in nordic countries, this style opts for bright open space, and the love of nature.
  - What Define Nordic style? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyjC_QYZdx4 NO.1 color palette - walls are typically paint in white colors - use wood/fur/texture to add more demensions to the space - use darker colors and thin lines - the minimumist commonly just use black+white+wood+plants as the palette. NO.2 Lighting - big windows white curtain - open spaces NO.3 Furniture - thin legs to avoid shade - always create spacious and airy feelings NO.4 Nature - lots of green - NO.5 Natural Materials - sheep skin/wool
  - Core value: of Nodic Design is go extreme on pragmatic functionality. https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Af4y197Ep Rule1: Don't spend money on the box. Nodic people don't want to spend money on the box(the house) style, all they want is white walls. Some nodic family has a bit classic style doors and wall decors, that is because that is old house, they don't want to spend money to change that. On the other hand, they spend a lot on furnitures. Because the walls are so simple, the furnitures become so outstanding. So Nodic mindset is the item must have good shape and color, simple enough so that they won't produce cluttered feelings, you don't have to buy furnitures designed by nordic people to have Nordic style. The They love modular home, by changing the poistion of the furnitures and not touching the box, the house maybe switched to another life style. Rule2:  Push progmatic usefulness to the extreme. Design everything from it's functionality. e.g reuse ladders/stackofbooks/cart as nightstand. open closet is welcomed, simple and cheap, use a curtain to avoid visual clutter. Expose power cord and everything Rule3: Follow your heart, as long as it is not ugly. You are allowed to combine anything together as you want, free to mix in some classic furniture in your space, be creative show your own personality is encouraged. 'as long as you type in Nordic Style in taobao, you are betraying Nordic style'
- Globals
  - white_box_size =  40cm*50cm*20cm
  - eveything white except there is a reason not to do so. For windows, white frame + white curtain = bright room + good background for my plants
  - Table
    - I don't like the iron leg sharp edge desks now
    - round corner is nice. safe for 2 yo. comfortable when you touch it
    - I want wood workbench like my dinning table now. round corner, light, legs removable, so very portable
    - I don't want screws exposed outside, you can hide them easily
    - I want it to be versatile, so no drawers. Want shirt not strechers, so that people fill comfortable sitting on the side.  that's maybe why most dinner tables don't need have strechers like desks
    - my own desk table material: Scots pine
    - size. If u want to put on a big iMac 110x75cm is the minimum space. I already have two desks for iMac, so I don't need to worry about this. so I am OK with 100x60cm, it's also more than enough as a dinner table for four.

## shelf_box_system
- elastic_box_philosophy everything is a box
  - everything should has it's own home, the home is a cuboid
  - think before shopping, how many walls do I need for a box
  - prefer flexiable structures(with pipes) over fixed sized boxes
- general idea
  - I can not change room size, so the larget box unit I can costomize is 'shelf space', based on stuctures I build by pipes
    - shelves are all about make use of vertical spaces, one idea on the big picture here is try to do things 'up in the air', so I can get more floor space for sports or sth.
    - then, everything left is generally put boxes on the shelf
    - of course, by 'boxes', I mean very large varity of boxes. 
      - I can lay things directly on the shelf, that means the boxes is made of air.
      - I can put another smaller thin-pipe shelf(with its own boxes) on a shelf
      - can be wood drawers, shallow boxes(to group other random containers), deep boxes, boxes with/without lids, box with hangers and one side covered by fabric(a closet unit)...
    - this does mean that I don't need specially structured containers like wardrobes, cabinets, closet, cupboards... yeah, my shelf-box model unify them all.
      - I don't even want seperator walls on my shelf boards, they are simple flat open space, just a board, not a box.
    - to go a bit far, I think, tables/stools/chairs/nightstands, anythings try to use the vertical spaces can be abstracted into my shelf-box model. E.g a table is a one layer shelf. See things this way will help me a lot when I stress on resue of pipes and wood boards.
    - shelf board 
      - I will stay will white boards, natrual wood color is beautiful, but you need to be careful about the things on it or the well behind it, since shelves may be placed anywhere, so I will stay with white for now
      - all shelf board needs to be wood, right now I don't accept metal net or anything
      - how to mount the boards on pipes?
        - a pipe box has three dimensions: height, width and depth. The common way to do it is to mount it cross the whole width, I will do it too. But sometimes, I want to mount smaller boards alone the depth direction, for example, if I want to place some big boxes on top of my closet, the closet roof does not need to be super strong. So it would be a waste to buy a really long board to cover all the roof, the I can mount several small boards and leave gags between each one.
        - it is easier to mount anything on wood board, say a curtain, or a sub-shelf.
      - board edges will become the edge of boxes, pipes are bones
- aesthetic rules
  - each box has its own border and margin, invasions are generally not allowed, unless you have a reason to do so. e.g two identical boxes put together without leaving margin for each other are considered a set
  - each item should take up as much as it's cuboid space, and try to make the cubiod smaller
  - boxes should be algined well
- pipes 
  - why I choose pipes for the backbone of my storage system?
  - I rent so I don't want to demage the walls, I may not have good built-in closets
  - if I want to make use of vertical space, I need something free-standable and strong
  - many solutions for this, e.g ready-made grocery shelf or clothes shelf, but I find pipes are more approchable and versatile
  - It's stupid to use big and heavy wood closet, it's overdo
    - it's not portable, how about I want to use it as a hanger to air dry my quilts
  - all I need is some pipe assembled together, if I want walls, use fabric, or I can use peg boards or nets as walls
  - I want the pipes to be really resuable
    - bad example: plug thin pipe in to holes of backbone pipe
      - this design is ugly and that meant you can not remodel the thing, once a thin pipe is removed that leaves a hole on the thick pipe
      - right way to do this is keeping both the thin and thick pipes intact, use joints
  - things should be well contained inside the cubiod
    - bad example: things outside of the box cuboid
      - most pipes should be the edges of the box, nothing should be outside the box
      - take closet for example, many design use the edge to hang clothes, that means the clothes will be outside the box, not allowed in my philosophy.
      - the right way to do it
        - use thick pipes for the edges, the edges are there to provide a strong stucture, not to hange clothes
      - install a thin pipe in the middle as hanger bar
    - pipe diameter: 25mm
      - 25mm with 1mm walls, very heavy and strong, for interior use, it is strong enough for anything I believe
      - hard metal pipe(and joints) of any diameter is esay to get
      - try to stay constant with this diameter, based on the price you can get very thin and very thick walls for different purpose
        - if all pipes are of the same diameter, that will make the pipes easy to reuse for other container models
    - joint
      - No welding
      - metal joints 
        - PPV is fine for same cases
        - No screw thread
      - https://youtu.be/yfHGFw5RDac?t=104
      - the joint works extremely well, two pipes connected with joint are as strong as one, so it is easy to extend the structure, say connect two boxes together.
    - legs

    - accessories

## project_closet
- Intro
  - this is a example project to use metal pipes
- make it big but cute
  - use open area https://youtu.be/8zmkPhH4cms?t=76
- the space we have
  - 60cm deep, 280cm height, 180cm width.
- Dimensions
  - deep: 55cm(my big closet is 52cm )
  - width: 125cm(3x40+5, 40 is $white_box_size width)
  - height: 160cm = 130cm(enough for long dresses like coat, or jackets + $white_box_size)+30cm(legs+space for a wheel board and shoeboxes)
  - a lamp with warm light https://youtu.be/eMvn7VOGrxQ?t=432
  - Side Note: the sizes are for the pipes, plus joins, the final demensions will be bigger, and that is intended.
- What do I have for the closet?
  - easily approachable
    - 1 sock box: 10widthx10hightx50deep 1 8th of the $white_box_size enough for 30-40 pairs(folded the MarinKondo way)
    - 2 underwear/t-shirt box: each is 20widthx10hightx50deep, 1/4 $white_box_size
    - 2 shoe boxes: together share a $white_box_size
    - 1 outwear box: each is $white_box_size
    - ideally a 3 layer dresser is good for all of the above
    - 1 hanging rod: 80cm long for 10-15 clothes
  - top of the roof
    - 3 $white_box_size for other clothes or stuff
  - don't block the light
- A light version, WHYNOTs
  - sth like this https://youtu.be/DvzWx2tHZ18?t=125
  - it's hard put some on top
  - no way to cover it to form a box shape
  - no walls, so no where to hang my peg boards or things on the side
  - it's really not stable and strong enough
- purchasing
  - pipe pp plugs: 7.1RMB in total
  - pipe 160x4 55x2(have 2 already) 125x4 130RMB in total
  - k joint 7(have 1 already) 6.5RMB/unit 
  - TOTAL COST: 202RMB
- use vertical space without taking up floor space
  - sth like https://youtu.be/WCyhIVKnOF8?t=63 but no nails in the walls
- how to mount board to the structure
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwkKYqWFA5g 
    - this is tricky, you need big&small joints work together to achieve this

## project_box_system
- style: https://youtu.be/ZEunyhWD_9c?t=152
  - paste names on each box https://youtu.be/7Ud2N1sssyw?t=23
- material: cardboard and maybe wood
- usecases
  - clothes storage box
  - shoebox
  - bed/sofa/stool
  - drawer
  - shallow container to group things
    - https://youtu.be/7Ud2N1sssyw?t=16
    - say I have a set of Masion jars, I can put all in a shallow box, so that I can still see most part of the jars.
- dimentions
  - ikea also has the storage unit concepts, I think I am doing something similar
    - https://www.ikea.com/kr/en/p/sopprot-pull-out-storage-unit-transparent-white-80376481/
  - based on my big white box size 50x40cm, the boxes I build will be half or one fourth of this size
  - exterior dementions
    - first generation(biggest box): 50x40x20 m $white_box_size
      - or some variation of the size, (50/2)*40x(20x2)=25x40x40
    - second generation: pick one or more dimension, divid by 2
      - shoe box: 40lenghtx25widthx20height (considering my biggest pair of boots size: 29length*23width*15height, but standard over perfect fit for each use case)
    - third generation: pick one or more dimension, divid by 4 or 2, you get the idea, tightly control the exterior size, so that two small box may share one big box height or width, so things will look nice stacked together
      - 25x20x10 (lengthxwidthxheight in cm)
    - fourth gen
      - 10x10x10cm
- cover 
  - with fabric, hemp rope, wall paper, or special paper, keep it cat resistant
  - kraft paper
  - how to cover with fabric https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m4LU5EvXSs
  - white glue is good to stick cloth to cardpaper
  - Polyvinyl acetate is also called wood glue or school glue, it's the same chemical we use for chewing gum
- handles
  - cut holes on walls https://youtu.be/wJakpURTxhM?t=271
  - use rope
- cap, simple is good https://youtu.be/wJakpURTxhM?t=1050
  - diy https://youtu.be/UwgQ8nHMZm4?t=77

## Rent consideration
  - can I rent a old apartment?
    - yes, the interior look does not matter, search '出租屋 改造‘ on youtube
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgcTbLfChV4
    - but, some requirements
      - soundproof windows/wall/door
      - proper heating
      - no furniture
      - sunshine
      - DIY tolerant landlord
      - you get the idea
  - repair the wall and lay the floor
    - https://youtu.be/hgcTbLfChV4?t=397

## Set the Style 
- wood_plant_palette
  - what is a color palette? as this lady put it https://youtu.be/1K4Fb6ENFBM?t=199 'it is a netural plus one or two popup colors', in my case, wood is my netural color and green is my popup color.
  - love the plants here, Small Apartment Makeover: 350 Square Feet Filled With DIYs
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWtCGXtdpQw
  -  Palette: white(60%) + wooden(from wood/fabric/rattan/sth 20%) + black(with pure-gray 10%) + bright-google-office-colors(my decor style, for small items)
    - light_wood_color 
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnNt76b818A
      - https://youtu.be/zN_3OxrhL8Q?t=9
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNwFAA4fE8
      - this one has similar floor color https://youtu.be/T2tl4cJJWLg?t=449 
      - you don't even need black lines to be beautiful https://youtu.be/fWdKxkzAokA?t=58
      - no need to have same color for all wood items
      - you can also use woodish color for blankets/pillows and things
    - https://studio-mcgee.com/8-design-tricks-we-used-in-dream-home-makeover/
      - Balancing warm & cool tones
      - wood is warm/natural, black is cold/industrial, it's very classic mixture.
    - get inspirations: search 'black and white room design' on pinterest
    - professionals does allow different tones of white and gray in same room, but I would like to stay cautious, use milk white and a limited number of gray, and try to stay constant.
    - this palette should be very tolerant to any other colors too I believe, especially when it's light
    - sliver and brown door color are toleranted
      - white and black theme are very tolerant of other colors, especially when this is only one color so the brown-red of doors and cabinets is not a problem, the problem is something else, maybe because the they not modern enough by itself, so the idea is not to fix the color, but to fix the style
        - adding bright color modern looking handles may help a lot https://youtu.be/SZzJhZ_TrfY?list=PLdgMcYYc0hOtRxQA9pHsY5WtaLxLKfYTf&t=25
        - my kitchen cabinet's problem is having a dark color body and darker top
      - light color floor plays well with my palette: https://studio-mcgee.com/8-design-tricks-we-used-in-dream-home-makeover/ check 'Add texture to bring neutral tones to life'
    - netrual color or cartoon-ish bright saturated color?
      - quick answer: I will strive for bright ones.
      - large items with bright color tend to look cheap, so do I need some more neutral colors for chairs and things? EC life's demo of black-white-gray theme  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LxU5AaCl-M , see the chair here, a netrual color. However, I don't beleive I am professional enough to control netural colors
        - It's really hard to get the combination right, even using different tones of grays
        - besides, I am a engineer, I love simplicity
  - why I don't have a theme color
    - having a theme color have two benefits
      - NO.1 set the tone for the home
      - NO.2 unify different rooms
    - but for now I prefer not to have a theme color
      - since I have the door-brown in everyroom to unify all rooms
        - there is a way to fix the color easily https://youtu.be/D5Dr3qrDDtA?t=610
      - but I don't design for the door-brown color, it is not my theme color
- shape
  - also, I want to keep things really cartoon-ish, try to aviod things with too much details, chubby, round corners, you watched Dragon Balls, so you get the idea.
- tricks
  - https://studio-mcgee.com/8-design-tricks-we-used-in-dream-home-makeover/ 'Incorporating cohesive finishes and elements throughout a home.'
    - this is easy for my case, black lines in everyroom.
- shopping guideline
  - the general rule is to buy white or bright color with chubby shape and round corners
    - even for wood things, I also want the color light.
    - I have lots of black frames and sharp corners, so there is a backbone and balance.
  - if I ever need to buy something, make it NO.1 white or NO.2 bright colors, NO.3 black NO.4 gray(pure black + white)
    - If you ever hesitate, then the color should be white, cause it's should be as invisable as possible, other colors may look like a stain
  - many things go well with black+white theme
    - https://youtu.be/NMsDFycKvIw?t=8 wooden things, flowers, leaves
  - all the tables/shelves should be white, cause the walls are white this could make them more invisible
    - therefore whatever you have on top of them become outstanding
    - photoframes then need to have darker color, this also obey the rules, cause a photo/poster is a item, not a background

## The Filesystem

Folder division based on phiscal locations. e.g the whole clothes storage system could be located in different rooms, then you have living_room/fabric_box and peter_room/closet, rathen then a big folder for all the device for clothes storage.

    - be modular with wears too https://youtu.be/4Mb9s6jZNug?t=129
      - no need to buy thick down jacket
  - what is neutral color?
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BDCJ7y50ew
  - what is muted color?
    - 'dirty color', pure color plus gray or its complimentary color
  - wear no more than one color
    - one color plug neutrals https://youtu.be/4Rc71BT2jbw?t=191
      - wear no more than one pattern, this meaning most of your clothes should be just have no pattern, just solid color

    - 'the benefits of using neutral colors is all your clothes work well together'
- how to may my cold/industrial room more homy?
  - add texture https://youtu.be/eMvn7VOGrxQ?t=147
  - non-refletive surfaces https://youtu.be/eMvn7VOGrxQ?t=153

  - still need to hang clothes in the first floor? make most outof the two corners I have
- home cinema
  - a monitor arm stands on my pipe shelf
    - I need this https://youtu.be/crjZBwbtlXQ?t=354

  - TODO: waiting for my pipes
  - speaker https://youtu.be/crjZBwbtlXQ?t=922
- socks hanger
  - same logic for socks as for clothes, when they gets dry, I can leave socks attached to the hanger, and put everything together in the socks storage box
  - MUST HAVES
    - be white, follow my design guideline
    - one clip for one sock
    - I don't want to hang each clip to the hanger one by one, that means the clips are tied to the hanger, but if it is really easy, that is OK.
    - the hanger will be small and light
    - not noisy, (metal hanger with 40 clips will be noisy)
    - small hook, or foldable, does take up lots of storage space
    - it's nice if the hanger itself is up in the air, when I clip the socks
      - if it is a big hanger with lots of clips, it's nice feature to be able to turn 
- rug
  - color
    - I need light gray https://youtu.be/T2tl4cJJWLg?t=449
  - has to be easy to clean with washing machine
  - a rug will make a room more homey
  - a failure
    - the rug delivered today was really beautil, dark and with beautiful curves
    - but it did it merge in my setting well, since my floor color is light, the rug really stood out
    - in comparison, my shelf and all the toys, looked so small and unimportant
    - so I returned the rug. 
    - if I really want a rug in the future, make it light wooden color.
    - the lesson: the living room is genral white background, and all the items are darker colors, so they stand out well, the logic is clear. so never buy big and outstanding things with unnessary deco-only curves or textures.
- dimensions
 - floor to ceiling height 267cm
 - floor width: 272cm floor length: 420cm
 - balcony entrency width: 172cm height: 233cm
 - balcony big window: 193heightx198width
- curtain
  - tip: curtain width usually is 2 times the window width, because of the folds
  - given my hanger style, curtain max hright is 257cm(then it will reach the floor)
  - when I move the window size could be different, so not wise to buy a expensive curtain
    - besides, I don't want a blackout for my small room
    - and cat might ruin the sheers as well
  - what about a short curtain with height 180cm
    - table height: 75cm, this meanings the bottom of the curtain is a bit lower than my table top
    - my floor is really reflective, but since I am siting really close to the curtain, so I won't see the direct reflection of the winter sunshine
    - being short is being cat-safe
  - what about white thicken voile sheers for my bedroom?
    - the balcony has roof, so the sunshine won't be as strong as living room
    - this is nordic style, love the demo videos on Pingduoduo
- quilt
  - use '水洗棉' Washed cotton https://youtu.be/Ou0Lp7UfNVw?t=141

- closet TODO
  - this will be done my shelf_box_system way
  - currently not enough place to hang clothes
  - for shoes/suitcases
  - have a lot of hangers of different sizes, when the clothes are dry, put them in the closet together with the hanger
  - most underwears can be put in smaller carboard box, as Marie Kondo suggested, group things by size. Don't use one same box for underware and jackets
  - keep all socks same color same size, keep them in a special box once they are dry.

      - PlanB: change my hanbit, don't make it wet everyday
        - keep towels in use in the bathroom
      - problem
        - no seperation between toliet and washing bowl, so no way to stop the smell
     - Solution:
       - go PlanB
       - only have one or two landary days per week, so that we enjoy a clean balcony for most time
       - buy more towels, save the dirty ones, wash them and hang them with other clothes
       - all towels purchursed in the future will be white
       - levelup the cleanliness standard for my bathroom
