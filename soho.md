title: My new home office design and implementation
---

NOTE: limit the indentation to 3 levels.

## Design Guidelines
- goal: My own flavor of Scandinavian Style: Minimun+Simplicity+Functionality(from Scandinavian)+Portable+Modular+Techy(from Myself)
  - minimum. Does a thing spark joy?
  - Simplicity. Limit the details https://youtu.be/2A7kjGzICA8?t=107 'when you have just 5 colors in your home, that feels more peaceful'. Things(items/shapes/curves/colors) should not exist if they do not add up aesthetic or functional value. Prefer single color items like chairs, plates etc.
  - functionality. simpler things are often more versatile。 you will be able to reuse them when upgrade your home over time, say, a simple table will be easily use for other purpose, a desk with lots of details may not fit well in your new home. Expose kitchen to living room, expose kitchen items for easy pickup, because of the minimum you can still control visual clutter. Scandinavian people believe 'Practical can be beautiful', e.g a beautiful cutboard. They don't hide things in a cabinet. They don't buy decor, they hang their bicycles on the wall, they use clothes as decoration.
  - portable
    - no damage to the walls
    - all the furniture parts should be easily to carry by myself
  - modular
    - furnitures should be very modular and extensible, easy to be replaced and upgraded on part each time. I will use pipes to make the spaces restructable.
    - also, think in systems, not each utility. For example, shoe storage is a problem I need to solve, think about how the shoe boxes with fit into the bigger $shelf_box_system. The system thinking is only possible, when I strive for strong standardization.
  - techy
    - have posters of github/google/code/editors , the theme is Coder's Home.
    - Unix Filesystem like org. say consider each container as a folder(a box), and tag names to it. e.g misc/ clothes/underwear/... have a beautiful filesystem hirachey so that things are easy to find. everything should have its home. everything is a box. folder should have walls(could be wall/table/phisical-box/thin-air), so that rooms won't look clustered.
- What is Scandinavian Style?
  - Why so white? because of the long winter in Scandinavian countries, this style opts for bright open space, and the love of nature.
    - try to keep white, really strong white, like this https://youtu.be/1A8d9aeUQlU?t=101, https://youtu.be/5IPL6OUnFw8?t=110 , remember, green and wood and black are just decoration. Room is based on beautiful white things with elegant curves. If you have to use colors, use pastels(for toys, I will use bright colors).
  - make sure it is clutter free. Less is more, is essential part of the style.
  - blend Modern with Rustic https://youtu.be/XxgwI_OCAOU?t=223
    - https://youtu.be/D8QqL9CjHTQ?t=34
  -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoT7P2iOkJU Scandinavian Interior Design | Defined and How to master it: There is a particular color palette that's associated with the Scandinavian decor and this includes the hue of grays, whites, browns and blanks. Peter Side Note: note the 's' after each color. I do use different whites for things, they works together. Brown is wood color, OK to have sth other than wood which is brown.
  - What Define Scandinavian style? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyjC_QYZdx4 NO.1 color palette - walls are typically paint in white colors - use wood/fur/texture to add more demensions to the space - use darker colors and thin lines - the minimumist commonly just use black+white+wood+plants as the palette. NO.2 Lighting. big windows white curtain and open spaces NO.3 Furniture. Thin legs to avoid shade, always create spacious and airy feelings NO.4 Nature. lots of green and dry leaves NO.5 Natural Materials, sheep skin/wool
  - Core value: Scandinavian Design goes extreme on pragmatic functionality. https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Af4y197Ep Rule1: Don't spend money on the box. Nodic people don't want to spend money on the box(the house) style, all they want is white walls. Some nodic family has a bit classic style doors and wall decors, that is because that is old house, they don't want to spend money to change that. On the other hand, they spend a lot on furnitures. Because the walls are so simple, the furnitures become so outstanding. So Nodic mindset is the item must have good shape and color, simple enough so that they won't produce cluttered feelings, you don't have to buy furnitures designed by Scandinavian people to have Scandinavian style. The They love modular home, by changing the poistion of the furnitures and not touching the box, the house maybe switched to another life style. Rule2:  Push progmatic usefulness to the extreme. Design everything from it's functionality. e.g reuse ladders/stackofbooks/cart as nightstand. open closet is welcomed, simple and cheap, use a curtain to avoid visual clutter. Expose power cord and everything Rule3: Follow your heart, as long as it is not ugly. You are allowed to combine anything together as you want, free to mix in some classic furniture in your space, be creative show your own personality is encouraged. 'as long as you type in Scandinavian Style in taobao, you are betraying Scandinavian style'
- Globals
  - white_box_size =  40cm*50cm*20cm
  - eveything white except there is a reason not to do so. For windows, white frame + white curtain = bright room + good background for my plants
  - Table
    - I don't like the iron leg sharp edge desks now
    - round corner is nice. safe for 2 yo. comfortable when you touch it
    - I want wood workbench like my dinning table now. round corner, light, legs removable, so very portable
    - I don't want screws exposed outside, you can hide them easily
    - I want it to be versatile, so no drawers. Want shirt not strechers, so that people fill comfortable sitting on the side.  that's maybe why most dinner tables don't need have strechers like desks
    - my current desk material: Scots pine
    - size. If u want to put on a big iMac 110x75cm is the minimum space. I already have two desks for iMac, so I don't need to worry about this. so I am OK with 100x60cm, it's also more than enough as a dinner table for four.

## lighting_system
- goal: hide light bulk, no light come directly to my eyes, the light bulb should targeting the things I want to see, not my eyes. 
- tips
  - use Self Locking Electrical Cable Connector https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32961577684.html
- three types of lighting
  - ambient: general alumination. Even though task and accent light also contribute to ambient lighting, but the ambient light set the predominant level and the mood of the space.
  - task: reading
  - accent: decorative lighting
- my solution:
  - use 3000k for all rooms as ambient, do keep all rooms the same to have a unified feel
    - why warm light are relaxing? because it's the color of sun set. and we human realize it's end of the day, and time to relax. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgM1jjSc0CE
    - cool boy even suggest don't use anything higher than 4000k https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pD4y1R7RQ?t=10m31s not good for sleeping
  - for living room, we may want 'enhancing light' (>4000k and high lumen) when I have parties, https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1H4411q7os?t=4m3s the idea is if I want a >4000k and Full brightness, you can get it, but usually I will keep 3000k for all rooms
  - >4000K for task light and accent light, these can vary from room to room
  - use more than one pendant lamps for dinning table
  - use some projection light for kitchen sink or stove, as task light
    - https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pD4y1R7RQ?t=12m23s projection light bulk brand Tross 乔斯
- ref: https://youtu.be/xeaeWoYH4z8?t=105
  - a super small shade pendant light https://youtu.be/xeaeWoYH4z8?t=110
- use shade for all bulb
  - 'never never use light without screen' https://youtu.be/LgM1jjSc0CE?t=452
- use just enough ambient light, dark background, make important things popup, e.g
  - https://youtu.be/ENc-0dufe_c?t=139
  - https://youtu.be/ENc-0dufe_c?t=226
  - you can use projection light as ambient, target the wall, the light reflected by the wall is soft
- temprature: ambient 3000k, task 4000k
- ref:  https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1W7411G7Z1?t=328
- a pendant light for dinner table
- floor lamp
  - https://youtu.be/r4g-nOjU4NA?t=1034
- bed room ceiling center lamp
  - follow the cool guy here  https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pD4y1R7RQ/?
    - have a soft center lamp to provide ambient light, no need to design task lights in advance, add them later, add as many as you want
  - you need to spend some money on the projection light
  - it only takes two screw to install https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pD4y1R7RQ/?t=108
  - he said projection light is clear and beautiful
    - 30-45 degree angle
- ketchen lighting
  - https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1FA41147sS?t=5m
  - pitfall: don't use projection light as task light, dark shade, at least not use one. preferably have more than one light for dish washing and dinner table.
- and https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pD4y1R7RQ?t=83
- creat layers https://youtu.be/ENc-0dufe_c?t=304
- I want a KFC favor warm light for my room 'Ambient lighting'
  - current solution is a 3w warm light led, I wonder how many lumens is needed for one squaremeter
    - https://www.alconlighting.com/blog/residential-led-lighting/how-do-i-determine-how-many-led-lumens-i-need-for-a-space/
      - 6w LED provides 450 lumens
      - 9squaremeter bedroom needs 1000-2000lumens  
- at least have three lights in one room
  - https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pD4y1R7RQ?t=83
  - my xiaomi table lamp serves my my 'task lighting'
  - the idea is ambiient lighting should be 1/3 of the level of task lighting
  - use one project light, targeting something beautiful.
- it is not wise to have dark floor and bright ceiling
  - it is wasteful
  - so make the ceiling lamp lower with long cord
- lumens
  - 60w old style light bulbs only have 550 lumens
  - best led can reach 6000lumen
  - 15m2 room 12w/960lm light as Ambient
    - the Chinese coolboy https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pD4y1R7RQ?t=83
      - lots of good content here
    - to my surprice, the cool boy use projection light as ambient light
    - usually led 0.8w/m2 is good, or 80lm/m2 
    - add as many task light as you want
  - don't worry about wasting energy
    - a very bright free stand lamp takes 41 days and nights to use 1kwh https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pD4y1R7RQ?t=83
      - that is 0.1rmb per 24hr
  - light temperature
    - use same temperature for all rooms
    - do not any light with temperature higher than 4000k
      - it is not good looking to have a >4000 and <3000 bulk next to each other, task light can be whiter, not make it no higher than 4000
    - CRI > 90

    - kitchen lighting
- three tips for interior lighting
  - NO.1 Use multiple light sources
  - NO.2 use dimmer
    - bright for parties, soft for watching TV
  - NO.3 Use right bulk
    - led is good
- calculate how much lumens you need
  - https://youtu.be/LgM1jjSc0CE?t=452 
    - for pathway 20lumens/squareFoot, 200lumens/squareMeter
    - for dinning table 30lumens/squareFoot
    - for task light 50lumens/squareFoot
### bottle_system
- will use lots bottles/jars for kitchen and bathroom
- labeling
  - for anything used in wet area, use transparent tape to stick, otherwise just use white glue
  - love the font https://youtu.be/8rKltrQ45ao?t=9
    - In my sketch, I have 'hannotate TC', which is quite close to it, clear and a little chubby, like it

## cleaning_tool_system
- S pattern
  - when cleaning with towel, go s pattern, not a cricle https://youtu.be/-C-ic2H24OU?t=506
- cup cleaning brush
  - MUST HAVES: strong handle, fur on top for cup bottom cleaning, easy to be cleaned
  - or can I use dish towel instead? TODO: try it.
- use short handle broom/dustpan for the rooms, use rag and mop more
  - easy curves to clean, able to hang or free stand
  - at least 30cm long handle for the broom frequent under table cleaning
    - this is nice, but my rooms requires something more heavy duty https://youtu.be/MKFagXLY3Ro?t=111
  - Ikea wood handle is pretty https://www.pinterest.jp/pin/13721973853876399/
  - the japanese one '日本儿童簸箕扫把' 
    - is nice in that it stands steadily and handle not long, easy to hide somewhere
    - next step maybe try to display-worthy broom https://www.remodelista.com/posts/domestic-science-display-worthy-household-brooms/
  - no color out of my palette, DIY wooden broom? 
  - small pan, so that I can dump the dust into the duskbin without making it dirty
- dish towels
  - have to be big and really absorbent
  - white or gray
- expose those towels
  - colors
    - white, light gray, https://youtu.be/8rKltrQ45ao?t=245, or maybe camel
  - rags: choose camel/brown/woodish or grey
  - dish towel: white
  - face towel: white
  - what is the best material for dish towels? 
    - Flour Sack(linen) is thin and dry quickly, that's great to aviod any smell IMO
    - microfiber
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oNPXa-pJwc
      - the strand is so fine, so that it can pick up anything
      - it's also very absorbent
      - good for cleaning screens
- how to clean hair on the floor? mop actually works
- use long handle broom and dustpan for garage
- 【意思生活】1000元改造老破小厕所 https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1HJ411M7n8/?spm_id_from=trigger_reload
- laundry
  - use differnt lauandry basket for different clothes https://youtu.be/UxXf8SZbtt8?t=193
  - do white wash
    - bleach: use hot water
    - water first, then bleach, lastly fabric
    - not for wool

## shelf_box_system
- Goal: Try to put eveythings in a box, and put boxes on shelves. Things should be, or be put in a box, unless there is a reason not to do so. For example, try to make cat home, flower pots and everything part of my box set. And maybe I don't need specially structured containers like wardrobes, cabinets, closet, cupboards... this system unifies them.
- I am not the only one who have a box system https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rKltrQ45ao&t=1s
  - big open shelf system does not have to be messy https://youtu.be/dwOC3Pn3q8s?t=367 'it is more fun, it helps us navigate more easily'
- elastic_box_philosophy: everything is a box https://youtu.be/4xLdisAvjx8?t=30
  - everything should has it's own home, the home is a cuboid
- general idea
  - I can not change room size, so the larget box unit I can costomize is 'shelf space', stands on stuctures I build by pipes
    - why not use wood rather than steel piples?
      - wood is cheaper(espically for smaller things), more customizable(not easy to cut steel)
        - let's take a simple table as example, 75cm height, top: 60*120
        - wood  
          - legs: 5x5x75, total: 70rmb
          - 4 aprons: 1.8x10x360cm totoal: 40rmb
          - top: same as pipe scheme
        - pipes
          - 100RMB for pipes
          - 8 joints: 50RMB
          - top: same as wood scheme
      - also can be made very resuable and deassemble(use less nails and more screws).
      - more people do tutorial on youtube about how to do wood, we call them carpenters
      - wood shelf can be almost boxes, I will make wood boxes anyway
      - so I will use wood for smaller things, say 20cm deep shelf. It's wasteful to use 25mm pipe to build 20cm deep shelf.
        - then how to build 20cm deep shelf? use pipes to build a 20cm deep box, say 120widthx80heightx20deep, install 2.5cm thick boards on the 120x80 frame to get a sort of fake wall, then mount 20widthx1.5thicknessx120length boards with brackets on the 'wall' to get the shelf.
      - for large structures, pipes are still nice, not more expensive or heavier than wood. Much more easy to build a stable tall structure than using wood.
    - shelves are all about make use of vertical spaces(ref: https://youtu.be/QmqDkSBCm-A?t=66), one idea on the big picture here is try to do things 'up in the air', so I can get more floor space for sports or sth. Then, everything left is generally put boxes on the shelf. Of course, by 'boxes', I mean very large varity of boxes. I can put another smaller thin-pipe shelf(with its own boxes) on a shelf
    - can be wood drawers, shallow boxes(to group other random containers), deep boxes, boxes with/without lids, box with hangers and one side covered by fabric(a closet unit)...
    - I don't even want seperator walls on my shelf boards, they are simple flat open space, just a board, not a box.
    - shelf board. all shelf board needs to be wood, right now I don't accept metal net or anything. how to mount the boards on pipes? A pipe box has three dimensions: height, width and depth. The common way to do it is to mount it cross the whole width, I will do it too. But sometimes, I want to mount smaller boards alone the depth direction, for example, if I want to place some big boxes on top of my closet, the closet roof does not need to be super strong. So it would be a waste to buy a really long board to cover all the roof, the I can mount several small boards and leave gags between each one. it is easier to mount anything on wood board, say a curtain, or a sub-shelf. board edges will become the edge of boxes, pipes are bones
- no_invasion_rule. each box has its own border and margin, invasions are generally not allowed, unless you have a reason to do so. e.g two identical boxes put together without leaving margin for each other are considered a set. each item should take up as much as it's cuboid space, and try to make the cubiod smaller. boxes should be algined well. As put here https://youtu.be/dwOC3Pn3q8s?t=682 'give room for things to breath'
- why I choose pipes_as_backbone of my storage system? I rent so I don't want to demage the walls. if I want to make use of vertical space, I need something free-standable and strong. Many solutions for this, e.g ready-made grocery shelf or clothes shelf, but I find pipes are more approchable and versatile. It's stupid to use big and heavy wood closet, it's a overdo mostly. it's not portable, how about I want to use it as a hanger to air dry my quilts. all I need is some pipe assembled together, if I want walls, use fabric, or I can use peg boards or nets as walls. I want the pipes to be really resuable. I will use sticky paper to give the pipes warm and clean finishes.
  - UPDATES: there are some pitfalls: NO.1 the join I use to connect pipes are not strong enough, the screw hole are easy to break, if I build large structure with them, I will worry falling. NO.2 the way I mount my wood board on top of the pipe is not aesthetic. NO.3 Exposing lots of steel pipes in the rooms for kids, does not give the feeling of warm and secure. NO.4 It's a design flaw to lay board on top of round, the contact is just a line, not a face, which makes a board not robust as it could be.

- one bad example would be: plug thin pipe in to holes of backbone pipe. this design is ugly and that meant you can not remodel the thing, once a thin pipe is removed that leaves a hole on the thick pipe, right way to do this is keeping both the thin and thick pipes intact, use joints.
- bad example: things outside of the box cuboid. most pipes should be the edges of the box, nothing should be outside the box. take closet for example, many design use the edge to hang clothes, that means the clothes will be outside the box, not allowed in my philosophy. the right way to do it is to use thick pipes for the edges, the edges are there to provide a strong stucture, not to hange clothes. install a thin pipe in the middle as hanger bar
- pipe diameter: 25mm. 25mm with 1mm walls, very heavy and strong, for interior use, it is strong enough for anything. hard metal pipe(and joints) of any diameter is esay to get. try to stay constant with this diameter, based on the price you can get very thin and very thick walls for different purpose. if all pipes are of the same diameter, that will make the pipes easy to reuse for other container models
- joint? No welding use metal joints. PPV is fine for same cases. No screw thread https://youtu.be/yfHGFw5RDac?t=104 . the joint works extremely well, two pipes connected with joint are as strong as one, so it is easy to extend the structure, say connect two boxes together.
- Accessories? - you get everything you can imagine on Pingduoduo - search 钢管挂钩 法兰 管架连接件 固定夹十字扣 光轴十字块 玻璃夹 卡扣 堵头 钢管内接头 - in English 'T joints' 'elbow joints' 'pipe clips'
- shelf design principles
  - I don't use large piece of wood board, smaller than 60x50cm
    - so that I can keep them very portable, and modular, perfectly safe to stay with 1.5cm thickness
    - but don't mount boards too close to each other, gaps get dirty easily
  - wood does not perform the structure backbone duty
    - so that I can use thin boards
    - I don't use flange, use pipe clips
  - shelf depth is 40cm
    - use at least 25mm thick board, to make the pipe structure very strong
      - mount smaller structure on the wood board
    - at 75cm high, ussually we have a countertop, that will be 60cm deep
      - a chubbies bottom gives the shelf more stability
    - both 40cm and 60cm are for board size
    - pipe box depth would be 30cm(need 25cm pipe to do the job)

## project_closet
- Intro
  - this is part of my shelf_box_system.
  - essentially, this is what I want https://youtu.be/kfRbTQrqY5M?t=137
  - note: this is a compound struture
    - 1 closet + 2 desk side shelf + 1 fake wall(in front of the desk)
    - every part mount togeter to make it really stable
- closet
  - make a pipe box
    - mount a wood pipe on top of the box as hanging rod
- this is how a modern closet/wardrobe shoube be like https://youtu.be/XWpdDXKeCtA?t=3
- the space we have
  - 60cm deep, 280cm height, 180cm width.
  - I am not the only guy who play hanging rod on that corner https://youtu.be/AShs_TGOJQI?t=694
- Dimensions
  - deep: 55cm(my big closet is 52cm )
  - width: 125cm(3x40+5, 40 is $white_box_size width)
  - height: 160cm = 130cm(enough for long dresses like coat, or jackets + $white_box_size)+30cm(legs+space for a wheel board and shoeboxes)
  - Side Note: the sizes are for the pipes, plus joins, the final demensions will be bigger, and that is intended.
- What do I have for the closet?
  - easily approachable
    - 1 sock box: 10widthx10hightx50deep 1 8th of the $white_box_size enough for 30-40 pairs(folded the MarinKondo way)
    - 2 underwear/t-shirt box: each is 20widthx10hightx50deep, 1/4 $white_box_size
    - 2 shoe boxes: together share a $white_box_size
    - 1 outwear box: each is $white_box_size
    - 1 hanging rod: 80cm long for 10-15 clothes
  - top of the roof
    - 3 $white_box_size for other clothes or stuff
  - don't block the light
- purchasing
  - pipe pp plugs: 7.1RMB in total
  - pipe 160x4 55x2(have 2 already) 125x4 130RMB in total
  - k joint 7(have 1 already) 6.5RMB/unit 
  - TOTAL COST: 202RMB
- use vertical space without taking up floor space
  - sth like https://youtu.be/WCyhIVKnOF8?t=63 but no nails in the walls

## project_box_system
- intro: This is part of my shelf_box_system. the goal is to have a set of boxes, that follow a fixed standards, so they are nicely aline of stack together. ikea also has the storage unit concepts, I think I am doing something similar https://www.ikea.com/kr/en/p/sopprot-pull-out-storage-unit-transparent-white-80376481/ .
- style: https://youtu.be/ZEunyhWD_9c?t=152
- paste names on each box https://youtu.be/7Ud2N1sssyw?t=23
- material: cardboard and maybe wood
- usecases
  - clothes storage box
  - shoebox
  - bed/sofa/stool
  - drawer
  - shallow container to group things https://youtu.be/7Ud2N1sssyw?t=16 , say I have a set of Mason jars, I can put all in a shallow box, so that I can still see most part of the jars.
  - anything.
- box_system_sizes
  - based on my white_box_size , the box sizes I build will be divided by a integer. all the sizes here are exterior.
  - first generation(biggest box)
    - $white_box_size 50lengthx40widthx20height
    - 25x40x40
  - second generation
    - shoe box: 40lenghtx25widthx20height (considering my biggest pair of boots size: 29length*23width*15height, but standard over perfect fit for each use case)
      - show boxes should fit naturally in the $shelf_box_system , actually it is a subsystem of the bigger $shelf_box_system. Right now, the subsystem is but a few boxes on shelf(plus my entryway shoe cabinet), later maybe it will extend to be a shoe shelf or wall.
  - third generatio
      - 25x20x10 (lengthxwidthxheight in cm)
  - fourth gen
      - 10x10x10cm
- cover 
  - with fabric, hemp rope, wall paper, or special paper, keep it cat resistant
  - kraft paper
  - how to cover with fabric https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m4LU5EvXSs
  - white glue is good to stick cloth to cardpaper
- handles
  - cut holes on walls https://youtu.be/wJakpURTxhM?t=271
  - use rope
  - use skirts https://youtu.be/RWNjzxypsSc?t=400
- lid
  - simple is good https://youtu.be/wJakpURTxhM?t=1050

## rent_requirments
- my dream home
  - a big open space = living room + dinning room + kitchen 
    - its really trendy to have open space https://youtu.be/7BB3YYy8RVw?t=60
    - living room is mainly for projector and crafts
    - share sunshine and maybe more importantly share heating
    - kitchen should have bigger countertop than my current one, enough space for both cutting board and draining rack. No small oily corners. preferably enough space for long hanging rod
  - bedroom/office for me and Billie each
    - just a big bedroom, big enough and face south
  - a classroom for Kid
    - this should be in its own room, not in the living room
    - so when Elon is taught, Billie or me is two doors away
  - a laundry room with sunshine to dry clothes
  - toliets have part of the day sunshine(e.g facing east/west) and a natural ventilation(a real window)
  - a open balcony 
  - so it's 
    dream home = (1 big + 4 medium)sunny rooms + (2toilets + 
- can I rent a old apartment? yes, the interior look does not matter, search '出租屋 改造‘ on youtube
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgcTbLfChV4
- requirements
  - network?
  - soundproof windows/wall/door
  - proper heating
  - no furniture preferably
  - window size, sunshine
  - DIY tolerant landlord
  - no bugs, espicially those who bite you
  - cooking stove? natural gas?
  - kitchen hood?
  - toliet bowl?
  - windows sealed well? thick walls?
  - noisy? dogs?
  - open space = living room + dinning room + kitchen
    - It's such a wonderful design, since all the spaces will share light, and heating.
    - I went to a big house, with standalone kitchen and living room and everything, I could tell it will be very expensive to heat up.

## Style
- wood_plant_palette: A minimumist palette https://youtu.be/lyjC_QYZdx4?t=171
  - what is a color palette? as this lady put it https://youtu.be/1K4Fb6ENFBM?t=199 'it is a netural plus one or two popup colors', in my case, wood is my netural color and green is my popup color.
  - EXAMPLE: love the plants here, Small Apartment Makeover: 350 Square Feet Filled With DIYs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWtCGXtdpQw
  - white(60%) + wooden(from wood/fabric/rattan/sth 20%) + green(10%)
  - Decor: bright-google-office-colors(e.g my dragon ball toys) and black lines(photo frames and things)
  - light_wood_color: wood is warm/natural, black is cold/industrial, it's very classic mixture.
      - https://youtu.be/Ax8fNpglBSY?t=14

      - https://youtu.be/zN_3OxrhL8Q?t=9
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNwFAA4fE8
      - this one has similar floor color like mine https://youtu.be/T2tl4cJJWLg?t=449 
      - you don't even need black lines to be beautiful https://youtu.be/fWdKxkzAokA?t=58
      - no need to have same color for all wood items
      - you can also use woodish color for blankets/pillows and things
      - https://studio-mcgee.com/8-design-tricks-we-used-in-dream-home-makeover/
      - get inspirations: search 'black and white room design' on pinterest
      - beautiful wood stick here https://youtu.be/D9oLsPoJ7w0?t=21 https://youtu.be/D9oLsPoJ7w0?t=45
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L08WVCYQZHA you can use a lot of wood, but avoid too much yellow from the wood, it's too saturated.
    - professionals does allow different tones of white and gray in same room, but I would like to stay cautious, use milk white and a limited number of gray, and try to stay constant.
    - sliver and brown door color are toleranted
      - white and black theme are very tolerant of other colors, especially when this is only one color so the brown-red of doors and cabinets is not a problem, the problem is something else, maybe because the they not modern enough by itself, so the idea is not to fix the color, but to fix the style
        - adding bright color modern looking handles may help a lot https://youtu.be/SZzJhZ_TrfY?list=PLdgMcYYc0hOtRxQA9pHsY5WtaLxLKfYTf&t=25
        - my kitchen cabinet's problem is having a dark color body and darker top
  - why I don't have a theme neutrual color?
    - having a theme color have two benefits, NO.1 set the tone for the home. NO.2 unify different rooms. But for now I prefer not to have a theme color, keep it simple.

## Kitchen

  - white+wood https://youtu.be/lnLiNNgN980?t=214
    - white cabinet + wooden countertop
  - the trick is make it as white as possible, then make sure every tool is beautiful, because they will popup with the white background
- spring onion
  - buy less than 1km everytime, wash and cut them all, save in 2 jars
- knife set
  - one chef's knife

  - both black plastic handle
- nice to have a knife block

    - brass color pans https://youtu.be/cdVuHljNl6A?t=87
  - https://youtu.be/cRs5z-pmozE?t=409
  - even you try to be very minimum, use same pots and woks for everything is not wise, it's wasteful to cook one egg with a large wok, right? more pots does not mean more work, you only need to wash one per meal.
  - a milk pot https://youtu.be/SF8XIusz150?t=687, for boiling eggs/milk/instant_noodles and heat up leftovers
  - a pan, for all fries. eggs/pork/...
    - a non-stick pan
    - have a universal lid
    - do I really need a pan? a wok is more versatile since it's deep enough for braising fish/beancurd/..
      - my current wok was designed to be versatile, it's heavy so that food won't cling easily, it has a pan-ish bottom, so that I can fry eggs, want to stew/braize? that's what it is for.
  - steaming pot to reheat the bread
    - reuse smaller pot for steaming? https://youtu.be/SF8XIusz150?t=768
    - Billie wants to make Chinese buns/bread, so maybe we need a big one
  - will build a pot hanging area on kitchen shelf, with curtain, make sure the pot handles are suitable to for this
  - a porriage pot, maybe a eletric one with timer?
  - current pot diameter: 22cm
- fruit basket: my current one is nice looking, but I am thinking, maybe I should switch to a big white bowl, when the current one is broken. Just like I may use a big bowl and not a vege drainer, just because, white bowl are simple and thus more versatile. I can use the bowl for noodles someday. And white bowls for everything also meaning less visual complexity for the rooms. Sometimes it's wise to stay simple and stupid.

    - they are flat bottom, that's meaning less curve, easy to clean but maybe not for sth really hot in it
    - try to use more plates, less bowls
  - A beautiful combination: Oftast plates and bamboo peggboard-ish plate rack
    - https://youtu.be/CioYwYRf8o4?t=50
    - I like the feel and silence when I put the plates back on the rack

  - everything in beautiful white and least curves
- vege drainer
  - Ikea has a good one https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1bD4y1Q7BN?t=55

- dish washing
  - 5 steps:
    - S0: Spary some diluted soap(pre-treating is key)
    - S1. cooking broom(first wave, with esay stain removed, now we see the hard clearly)
    - S2. use sth harder like Loofah Sponge, use soap if needed then rinse(second wave)
    - S3. Dish Towel (third wave, you dont want a small dishtowel https://youtu.be/_MUfq-M087M?list=WL&t=764)
    - S4. Clean Tools/CounterTop/Table.
  - cooking broom is nice, but I may consider this https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1bD4y1Q7BN?t=184
  - consider Ikea tartsmet brush https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.5-b-s.w4011-22402964982.141.2890a863LySWsv&id=610999436833&rn=e4480f0c94a5cdaf8028357c1184f76a&abbucket=15
  - for sponge, my current flat grup pad is actully recommended by 'clean my space' https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1gK411K73h/?spm_id_from=333.788.videocard.18
    - I may also need a brighter color one, it's esay to clean but mine still dirty visually
  - NOTE: these steps only works for 2-7 dishes case, if you have a lot of dish, add hot soapy water and drainage steps.
  - Tips: wash the cleanest first, like cups, then to plates, and wok/pan last. Have two dish towels and use them interchangeably, give one of them time to dry, otherwise they get smelly.

    - I think I will lean on Ikea solutions, I don't want to buy a box from a small brand, and later can not find the same style anymore.
  - phase one: a 120x60x75 table
    - use 2.5cm wood board, 60x20x2.5cm, may need 5 or 6 (with or without gap)
    - pipes: four 125cm, four 40cm, two 75cm(legs), two 160cm(legs)
  - style, black pipe + wood board, there is a img in sketch file

- socks storage
  - even 25 height box is not perfect to stock socks, but a specially build box is still hard to manage.
  - besides, It won't work with a lided box or a open box, it MUST be a drawer to store the things, since I open it frequently. So I will keep using my big white box for socks, not perfect, but still the best solution I can get before I can DIY my own wood drawers/dressers.
- socks hanger
  - same logic for socks as for clothes, when they gets dry, I can leave socks attached to the hanger, and put everything together in the socks storage box
  - MUST HAVES
    - be white, follow my design guideline
    - one clip for one sock
    - I don't want to hang each clip to the hanger one by one, that means the clips are tied to the hanger, but if it is really easy, that is OK.
    - the hanger will be small and light
    - not noisy, (metal hanger with 40 clips will be noisy)
    - small hook, or foldable, does take up lots of storage space
    - it's nice if the hanger itself is up in the air, when I clip the socks
      - if it is a big hanger with lots of clips, it's nice feature to be able to turn 
- rug
  - color
    - I need light gray https://youtu.be/T2tl4cJJWLg?t=449
  - has to be easy to clean with washing machine
  - a rug will make a room more homey
  - a failure
    - the rug delivered today was really beautil, dark and with beautiful curves
    - but it did it merge in my setting well, since my floor color is light, the rug really stood out
    - in comparison, my shelf and all the toys, looked so small and unimportant
    - so I returned the rug. 
    - if I really want a rug in the future, make it light wooden color.
    - the lesson: the living room is genral white background, and all the items are darker colors, so they stand out well, the logic is clear. so never buy big and outstanding things with unnessary deco-only curves or textures.
- curtain
  - how to join two poles together https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3ZopIwcI4w
  - tip: curtain width usually is 2 times the window width, because of the folds
  - given my hanger style, curtain max hright is 257cm(then it will reach the floor)
  - when I move the window size could be different, so not wise to buy a expensive curtain
    - besides, I don't want a blackout for my small room
    - and cat might ruin the sheers as well
  - what about a short curtain with height 180cm
    - table height: 75cm, this meanings the bottom of the curtain is a bit lower than my table top
    - my floor is really reflective, but since I am siting really close to the curtain, so I won't see the direct reflection of the winter sunshine
    - being short is being cat-safe
  - what about white thicken voile sheers for my bedroom?
    - the balcony has roof, so the sunshine won't be as strong as living room

  - most underwears can be put in smaller carboard box, as Marie Kondo suggested, group things by size. Don't use one same box for underware and jackets
  - keep all socks same color same size, keep them in a special box once they are dry.

- 轻钢 light steel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmxkUiQ2T_c
  - <1mm thickness, it's really suprising
  - but the structure is super safe, it actully just need far less steel to hold the weight of everythings, but the problem is steel is easy to be twisted,, that's why people need to use more steel for the structure. Anyway, it's super safe for things like earthquick.
  - https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/246386753619278204.html
  - after years of use, the steel is still  100 percent recyclable
  - the wall is also super heat keeping, you save 75% money on heating
  - esay to be prefabricated, industrialization friendly
  - only problem: might produce some noise inside rooms
  - https://youtu.be/XRTNKDUW2uw?t=24
    - 2000rmb/m2 for everything
    - 30w for 150m2 
    - https://youtu.be/XRTNKDUW2uw?t=75 you can have a comtempary style hourse with light steel
      - 7200~7500rmb/ton 25~30m2/ton, so for a 150m2 house, the steel is just 50000RMB
- https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1UJ411j7Yh
  - 1080rmb/m2 without finish, done within one month

- tmp: change my Macbook Pro battary
  - follow this MAYBE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AabLlHT503o&list=WL&index=1&t=1236s
    - many people leave comments down below to say the steps in the video are redundant, just removing the speaker or remove nothing at all will still work, just a bit dangerous for the components around the battary, since the glue remover will disrolve plastics.
    - my plan is to have a first try, remove the battary without glue remover
    - easyway to do it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQXU1lryIY
      - why the hard way tear the whole computer off is because the guy needed to remove the speakers first. But actually it is not necessary.
