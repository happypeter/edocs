title: My new home office design and implementation
---

NOTE: part of the [mars](mars) project, foucsing on things lighter & portable. 

## Design Guidelines
- goal: My own flavor of Scandinavian Style: Minimun+Simplicity+Functionality(from Scandinavian)+Portable+Modular+Techy(from Myself)
  - minimum. Does a thing spark joy, otherwise why keep it.
  - Simplicity. Limit the details https://youtu.be/2A7kjGzICA8?t=107 'when you have just 5 colors in your home, that feels more peaceful'. Things(items/shapes/curves/colors) should not exist if they do not add up aesthetic or functional value. Prefer single color items like chairs, plates etc.
  - functionality. simpler things are often more versatile。 you will be able to reuse them when upgrade your home over time, say, a simple table will be easily use for other purpose, a desk with lots of details may not fit well in your new home. Open kitchen to living room, expose kitchen items for easy pickup, because of the minimum you can still control visual clutter. Scandinavian people believe 'Practical can be beautiful', e.g a beautiful cutboard. They don't hide things in a cabinet. They don't buy decor, they hang their bicycles on the wall, they use clothes as decoration. And, you can make rooms multipurpose, like the lady use dinning room as workspace https://youtu.be/3wnRv1ptyzg?t=654, I like the idea. I will prefer 'functionality over form', the home should aid my efficiency, e.g a powerful kitchen, great cleaning_system, easy to clean toilet and so on, any home should optimize for family's health, e.g a good lighting_system. 
  - portable
    - no damage to the walls
    - all the furniture parts should be easily to carry by myself
  - modular
    - furnitures should be very modular and extensible, easy to be replaced and upgraded on part each time.
    - also, think in systems, not each utility. I strive for strong standardization. Before purchasing, think about how a thing's size and usage and colors fit into current systems.
  - techy
    - have posters of github/google/code/editors , the theme is Coder's Home.
    - Unix Filesystem like org. say consider each container as a folder(a box), and tag names to it. e.g misc/ clothes/underwear/... have a beautiful filesystem hirachey so that things are easy to find. everything should have its home. everything is a box. folder should have walls(could be wall/table/phisical-box/thin-air), so that rooms won't look clustered.
    - standardlization
      - I live in a era when poverty are not solved. As a engineer, I beleive the only way to solve it is to push industiralization forward. So I will buy from big vendor, like Ikea, and all bowls/boxes and everything should have same sizes unless there is a reason to alter. Push economies of scale for any industries. Unify things possible, use my shelf_box_system to replace cabinets/tables/flowerstand/... whenever possible. E.g All the lamps should be the same, unless their is a clear reason not to do so. This way I have time to focus on searching for the best lamp with good enough price.
    - automation friendly: make the floor clean, so that I can use the robot vacuum.
- What is Scandinavian Style?
  - Why so white? because of the long winter in Scandinavian countries, this style opts for bright open space, and the love of nature.
    - everybody loves open space home https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Np4y167ti/
    - try to keep white, really strong white, like this https://youtu.be/1A8d9aeUQlU?t=101, https://youtu.be/5IPL6OUnFw8?t=110 , remember, green and wood and black are just decoration. Room is based on beautiful white things with elegant curves. If you have to use colors, use pastels(for toys, I will use bright colors).
  - make sure it is clutter free. Less is more, is essential part of the style.
  - blend Modern with Rustic https://youtu.be/XxgwI_OCAOU?t=223
    - https://youtu.be/D8QqL9CjHTQ?t=34
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lur6sbfZ_qE
  -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoT7P2iOkJU Scandinavian Interior Design | Defined and How to master it: There is a particular color palette that's associated with the Scandinavian decor and this includes the hue of grays, whites, browns and blanks. Peter Side Note: note the 's' after each color. I do use different whites for things, they works together. Brown is wood color, OK to have sth other than wood which is brown.
  - What Define Scandinavian style? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyjC_QYZdx4 NO.1 color palette - walls are typically paint in white colors - use wood/fur/texture to add more demensions to the space - use darker colors and thin lines - the minimumist commonly just use black+white+wood+plants as the palette. NO.2 Lighting. big windows white curtain and open spaces NO.3 Furniture. Thin legs to avoid shade, always create spacious and airy feelings NO.4 Nature. lots of green and dry leaves NO.5 Natural Materials, sheep skin/wool
  - Core value: Scandinavian Design goes extreme on pragmatic functionality. https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Af4y197Ep Rule1: Don't spend money on the box. Nodic people don't want to spend money on the box(the house) style, all they want is white walls. Some nodic family has a bit classic style doors and wall decors, that is because that is old house, they don't want to spend money to change that. On the other hand, they spend a lot on furnitures. Because the walls are so simple, the furnitures become so outstanding. So Nodic mindset is the item must have good shape and color, simple enough so that they won't produce cluttered feelings, you don't have to buy furnitures designed by Scandinavian people to have Scandinavian style. The They love modular home, by changing the poistion of the furnitures and not touching the box, the house maybe switched to another life style. Rule2:  Push progmatic usefulness to the extreme. Design everything from it's functionality. e.g reuse ladders/stackofbooks/cart as nightstand. open closet is welcomed, simple and cheap, use a curtain to avoid visual clutter. Expose power cord and everything Rule3: Follow your heart, as long as it is not ugly. You are allowed to combine anything together as you want, free to mix in some classic furniture in your space, be creative show your own personality is encouraged. 'as long as you type in Scandinavian Style in taobao, you are betraying Scandinavian style'
- Eveything white. except there is a reason not to do so. For windows, white frame + white curtain = bright room + good background for my plants
- Table
  - round corner is nice. safe for 2 yo. comfortable when you touch it
  - I want wood workbench like my dinning table now. round corner, light, legs removable, so very portable
  - I don't want screws exposed outside, you can hide them easily
  - I want it to be versatile, so no drawers. Want shirt not strechers, so that people fill comfortable sitting on the side.  that's maybe why most dinner tables don't need have strechers like desks
  - my current desk material: Scots pine
  - size. If u want to put on a big iMac 110x75cm is the minimum space. I already have two desks for iMac, so I don't need to worry about this. so I am OK with 100x60cm, it's also more than enough as a dinner table for four.

## lighting_system
- goal: hide light bulk, no light come directly to my eyes, the light bulb should targeting the things I want to see, not my eyes. 
- pendant shade
  - least curve, with simple pure shapes only, cubic, ball, half ball, cylinder etc. 
    - https://item.jd.com/55261210582.html
- even lighting is better lighting
  - Use a broad light source. The broader the light source, the softer the light coming out of it. I am so happy about my MI lamp Pro.
- led bulbs: main work horse, https://item.jd.com/7466255.html Opple warm(2700-3500k) light.
- tips
  - use Self Locking Electrical Cable Connector https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32961577684.html
  - dark backgroud plus bright item https://youtu.be/p9286KaJjb0?t=181
  - https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1kt4y1Y7z3?from=search&seid=13948915908318026828
- three types of lighting
  - ambient: general alumination. Even though task and accent light also contribute to ambient lighting, but the ambient light set the predominant level and the mood of the space.
  - task: reading
  - accent: decorative lighting
- my solution:
  - use 3000k for all rooms as ambient, do keep all rooms the same to have a unified feel
    - 'you don't want to exceed 3200k in your room' https://youtu.be/_ngjebdFVUY?t=374
    - why warm light are relaxing? because it's the color of sun set. and we human realize it's end of the day, and time to relax. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgM1jjSc0CE
    - cool boy even suggest don't use anything higher than 4000k https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pD4y1R7RQ?t=10m31s not good for sleeping
  - lady 小姜 use 2700k as ambient, and other place nothing over 3000k https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1W7411G7Z1?t=539
  - for living room, we may want 'enhancing light' (>4000k and high lumen) when I have parties, https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1H4411q7os?t=4m3s the idea is if I want a >4000k and Full brightness, you can get it, but usually I will keep 3000k for all rooms
  - >4000K for task light and accent light, these can vary from room to room
  - use more than one pendant lamps for dinning table
  - use some projection light for kitchen sink or stove, as task light
    - https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pD4y1R7RQ?t=12m23s projection light bulk brand Tross 乔斯
- ref: https://youtu.be/xeaeWoYH4z8?t=105
  - a super small shade pendant light https://youtu.be/xeaeWoYH4z8?t=110
- use shade for all bulb
  - 'never never use light without screen' https://youtu.be/LgM1jjSc0CE?t=452
- use just enough ambient light, dark background, make important things popup, e.g
  - https://youtu.be/ENc-0dufe_c?t=139
  - https://youtu.be/ENc-0dufe_c?t=226
  - you can use projection light as ambient, target the wall, the light reflected by the wall is soft
- temprature: ambient 3000k, task 4000k
- ref:  https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1W7411G7Z1?t=328
- a pendant light for dinner table
- floor lamp
  - https://youtu.be/r4g-nOjU4NA?t=1034
- bed room ceiling center lamp
  - follow the cool guy here  https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pD4y1R7RQ/?
    - have a soft center lamp to provide ambient light, no need to design task lights in advance, add them later, add as many as you want
  - you need to spend some money on the projection light
  - it only takes two screw to install https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pD4y1R7RQ/?t=108
  - he said projection light is clear and beautiful
    - 30-45 degree angle
- ketchen lighting
  - https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1FA41147sS?t=5m
  - pitfall: don't use projection light as task light, dark shade, at least not use one. preferably have more than one light for dish washing and dinner table.
- and https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pD4y1R7RQ?t=83
- creat layers https://youtu.be/ENc-0dufe_c?t=304
- I want a KFC favor warm light for my room 'Ambient lighting'
  - current solution is a 3w warm light led, I wonder how many lumens is needed for one squaremeter
    - https://www.alconlighting.com/blog/residential-led-lighting/how-do-i-determine-how-many-led-lumens-i-need-for-a-space/
      - 6w LED provides 450 lumens
      - 9squaremeter bedroom needs 1000-2000lumens  
- at least have three lights in one room
  - https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pD4y1R7RQ?t=83
  - my xiaomi table lamp serves my my 'task lighting'
  - the idea is ambiient lighting should be 1/3 of the level of task lighting
  - use one project light, targeting something beautiful.
- it is not wise to have dark floor and bright ceiling
  - it is wasteful
  - so make the ceiling lamp lower with long cord
- lumens
  - 60w old style light bulbs only have 550 lumens
  - best led can reach 6000lumen
  - 15m2 room 12w/960lm light as Ambient
    - the Chinese coolboy https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pD4y1R7RQ?t=83
      - lots of good content here
    - to my surprice, the cool boy use projection light as ambient light
    - usually led 0.8w/m2 is good, or 80lm/m2 
    - add as many task light as you want
  - don't worry about wasting energy
    - a very bright free stand lamp takes 41 days and nights to use 1kwh https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pD4y1R7RQ?t=83
      - that is 0.1rmb per 24hr
  - light temperature
    - use same temperature for all rooms
    - do not any light with temperature higher than 4000k
      - it is not good looking to have a >4000 and <3000 bulk next to each other, task light can be whiter, not make it no higher than 4000
    - CRI > 90

    - for dinning table 30lumens/squareFoot
    - for task light 50lumens/squareFoot

## cleaning_tool_system
- S pattern
  - when cleaning with towel, go s pattern, not a cricle https://youtu.be/-C-ic2H24OU?t=506
- cup cleaning brush
  - MUST HAVES: strong handle, fur on top for cup bottom cleaning, easy to be cleaned
  - or can I use dish towel instead? TODO: try it.
- use short handle broom/dustpan for the rooms, use rag and mop more
  - easy curves to clean, able to hang or free stand
  - at least 30cm long handle for the broom frequent under table cleaning
    - this is nice, but my rooms requires something more heavy duty https://youtu.be/MKFagXLY3Ro?t=111
  - Ikea wood handle is pretty https://www.pinterest.jp/pin/13721973853876399/
  - the japanese one '日本儿童簸箕扫把' 
    - is nice in that it stands steadily and handle not long, easy to hide somewhere
    - next step maybe try to display-worthy broom https://www.remodelista.com/posts/domestic-science-display-worthy-household-brooms/
  - no color out of my palette, DIY wooden broom? 
  - small pan, so that I can dump the dust into the duskbin without making it dirty
- dish towels
  - have to be big and really absorbent
  - white or gray
- expose those towels
  - colors
    - white, light gray, https://youtu.be/8rKltrQ45ao?t=245, or maybe camel
    - white, light gray, https://youtu.be/8rKltrQ45ao?t=245, or maybe camel
  - rags: choose camel/brown/woodish or grey
  - dish towel: white
  - face towel: white
  - what is the best material for dish towels? 
    - Flour Sack(linen) is thin and dry quickly, that's great to aviod any smell IMO
    - microfiber
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oNPXa-pJwc
      - the strand is so fine, so that it can pick up anything
      - it's also very absorbent
      - good for cleaning screens
- how to clean hair on the floor? mop actually works
- use long handle broom and dustpan for garage
- 【意思生活】1000元改造老破小厕所 https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1HJ411M7n8/?spm_id_from=trigger_reload
- laundry
  - use differnt lauandry basket for different clothes https://youtu.be/UxXf8SZbtt8?t=193
    - https://youtu.be/CKSl49NdmFg?t=61
  - do white wash
    - bleach: use hot water
    - water first, then bleach, lastly fabric
    - not for wool

## shelf_box_system
- Goal: Try to put eveythings in a box, and put boxes on shelves. Things should be, or be put in a box, unless there is a reason not to do so. For example, try to make cat home, flower pots and everything part of my box set. I rent so I don't want to demage the walls. if I want to make use of vertical space, I need something free-standable and strong, say shelves. Try to make things really simple and thus reusable.
- PlanA: DIY with round pipe and wood board
  - Abandoned for 2 reasons: NO.1 round pipes are not for shelves, shoud use square pipes NO.2 Joint screws should go all the way through the pipes if you want strong structures, not like the joints I had.
- PlanB: DIY with wood
  -  Abandoned for reasons: NO.1 DIY takes time PERIOD, thinks about the round edges and different finishes. NO.2 Good Engineers love libaries(ready made builing blocks). NO.3 For large structures, best engineering choice is still to use iron legs, if you want a clean lean structure and keep your rooms airy and bright.
- PlanC: use mass produced square pipe shelves
  - limit the colors to wood+white ONLY
  - use exactly same shelves for similar tasks
  - but for much bigger/smaller/different usecases, I am free to switch to other shelves
  - bathroom shelf 
    - https://item.jd.com/3327229.html#crumb-wrap
    - https://item.jd.com/100012221566.html#crumb-wrap
  - main_workhorse_shelf (try to use it for as many cases as possiable)
    - tall square steel pipe/adjustableLayerHeight/30cmDeep https://item.jd.com/72036557276.html#crumb-wrap
    - 溢彩年华 进口实木置物架落地花架厨房收纳架家用储物架学生卧室移动书架 YCI6046-WH https://item.jd.com/100003817646.html#crumb-wrap
    - artful/light/modular
- I am not the only one who have a box system https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rKltrQ45ao&t=1s
  - big open shelf system does not have to be messy https://youtu.be/dwOC3Pn3q8s?t=367 'it is more fun, it helps us navigate more easily'
- no_invasion_rule. everything should has it's own home, the home is a cuboid. Each box has its own border and margin, invasions are generally not allowed, unless you have a reason to do so. e.g two identical boxes put together without leaving margin for each other are considered a set. each item should take up as much as it's cuboid space, and try to make the cubiod smaller. boxes should be algined well. As put here https://youtu.be/dwOC3Pn3q8s?t=682 'give room for things to breath'

## project_peg_boards

- https://youtu.be/kfRbTQrqY5M?t=33

## project_closet
- a wood simple rod closet https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/346115273
  - Pitfall: When you have dark color clothes, this style looks bad
  - A curtain is kind of necessary
- this is how a modern closet/wardrobe shoube be like 
  - DIY, square wood & curtain https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1yJ41157f8/?spm_id_from=333.788.recommend_more_video.4
    - When I purchasing my own, make sure boxes can be put under short clothes
    - have some open space that I can put folded thick clothes
      - https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1fE411r76f?t=1m4s
    - have some ppv tubs as drawers
  - https://youtu.be/XWpdDXKeCtA?t=3
  - https://item.jd.com/66874460142.html  (purchased)
    - have curtain if needed https://item.jd.com/66987839616.html
- boxes needed with the closet?
  - easily approachable
    - 1 sock box: 10widthx10hightx50deep 1 8th of the $white_box_size enough for 30-40 pairs(folded the MarinKondo way)
    - 2 underwear/t-shirt box: each is 20widthx10hightx50deep, 1/4 $white_box_size
    - 2 shoe boxes: together share a $white_box_size
    - 1 outwear box: each is $white_box_size

## project_box_system
- intro: This is part of my shelf_box_system. the goal is to have a set of boxes, that follow a fixed standards, so they are nicely aline of stack together. ikea also has the storage unit concepts, I think I am doing something similar https://www.ikea.com/kr/en/p/sopprot-pull-out-storage-unit-transparent-white-80376481/ .
- cardboard_boxes
  - still make a lot sense for tubs
    - DIY this https://www.ikea.com/jp/ja/p/droena-box-white-70262828/
    - or buy Ikea Drona tubs, if you don't want lids
    - with lids https://www.ikea.com/jp/en/p/tjena-storage-box-with-lid-black-40469298/
  - I can have whatever size I need, without or with lids
  - sizes accord to shelves
  - use same wallpaper to do finishing for least visual clutter
  - when I need drawer or water-proof usecase, I will go for plastic ones
- different generation boxes/jars/bottles/etc
  - labeling: for anything used in wet area, use transparent tape to stick, otherwise just use white glue
  - love the font https://youtu.be/8rKltrQ45ao?t=9
    - In my sketch, I have 'hannotate TC', which is quite close to it, clear and a little chubby, like it
  - each gen should have same boxes
  - different gen servee different purpose, thus can have unrelated size/material
  - watch shelf sizes
- big storage box for clothes and other fabric
  - 爱丽思抽屉式收纳箱衣柜透明 https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=39138096663
  - size: 40cm*50cm*20cm
  - smaller size
    - one for socks, the other for underwear, another for Elon's clothes
    - for often used things, drawer is a must. Sockets with lids won't work.
    - but I don't want the transparent front, add visual clutter, not to mention there is annoying logo on it
    - nice alternative https://item.jd.com/10022323972405.html
- Plastic open box for kitchen
  - to contain jars/bottles
  - 拼多多：奈特小店，素色桌面收纳盒 30cm*20cm*13

## Style
- wood_plant_palette: A minimumist palette https://youtu.be/lyjC_QYZdx4?t=171
  - what is a color palette? as this lady put it https://youtu.be/1K4Fb6ENFBM?t=199 'it is a netural plus one or two popup colors', in my case, wood is my netural color and green is my popup color.
  - EXAMPLE: love the plants here, Small Apartment Makeover: 350 Square Feet Filled With DIYs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWtCGXtdpQw
  - white(60%) + wooden(from wood/fabric/rattan/sth 20%) + green(10%)
    - THE general rule is everything should be white unless it is a reason not to do so. It's very hard to get colors and don't add unnecessary visual clutter. Sometimes, using color is very tricky, for example, my current wood kitchen shelf is becautiful by itself, but because the darker wood color, my pure white oven and microwave stand out, since they are of different shape, they don't look tidy together, if my shelf is white, the outline of my applience will merge into the backgroud more, and you get a more coheisive overall look. check this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV-TXCh43go . Besides, if you have more than one or two wood tones, your room will not look modern https://youtu.be/FK7m3HE-nR8?t=51 , so safe choice is just go all white. 
  - Decor: bright-google-office-colors(e.g my dragon ball toys) and black lines(photo frames and things)
  - why white? Minimum does not only mean own less, but also less distractions. Colors always get my attention when I don't want to.
  - light_wood_color: wood is warm/natural, black is cold/industrial, it's very classic mixture.
    - if not easy to use wood color, if your chair and desk has different undertone, they will look ugly https://youtu.be/FK7m3HE-nR8?t=151 . So try to use less wood, try to go 100% white. 
    - NOTE: I will prefer my rooms more techy then homy. Because this makes the room more functional. like in https://youtu.be/kOO9UFGWtME?t=195 , with the cold black-white style, it's OK to have more things in the room, but still looks not so cluttered.

      - https://youtu.be/zN_3OxrhL8Q?t=9
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNwFAA4fE8
      - this one has similar floor color like mine https://youtu.be/T2tl4cJJWLg?t=449 
      - you don't even need black lines to be beautiful https://youtu.be/fWdKxkzAokA?t=58
      - no need to have same color for all wood items
      - you can also use woodish color for blankets/pillows and things
      - https://studio-mcgee.com/8-design-tricks-we-used-in-dream-home-makeover/
      - get inspirations: search 'black and white room design' on pinterest
      - beautiful wood stick here https://youtu.be/D9oLsPoJ7w0?t=21 https://youtu.be/D9oLsPoJ7w0?t=45
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L08WVCYQZHA you can use a lot of wood, but avoid too much yellow from the wood, it's too saturated.
    - professionals does allow different tones of white and gray in same room, but I would like to stay cautious, use milk white and a limited number of gray, and try to stay constant.
    - sliver and brown door color are toleranted
      - white and black theme are very tolerant of other colors, especially when this is only one color so the brown-red of doors and cabinets is not a problem, the problem is something else, maybe because the they not modern enough by itself, so the idea is not to fix the color, but to fix the style
  - why I don't have a theme neutrual color?
    - having a theme color have two benefits, NO.1 set the tone for the home. NO.2 unify different rooms. But for now I prefer not to have a theme color, keep it simple.

## The Filesystem
Folder division based on locations. e.g the whole clothes storage system could be located in different rooms, then you have living_room/fabric_box and peter_room/closet, rathen then a big folder for all the device for clothes storage.

  - billie_office/
    - desk

- All-Electric Cooking Appliances
  - Mi Oven + Mi Microwave + Mi Electric Stove(with pans/pots/steamer)
  - currently pass: Mi Steam Oven + Air Fryer
  - the reasoning: Baked receipes are ture time saver, you can basiclly throw whatever you want to eat and start the timer. I have left-overs and buy take-homes very own, so keeping a microwave is for sure a must. And I can not go without stir-fry(all dishes) or pan-fry(eggs) or steamer, that's why I also need a electric stove.
  - MI Microwave
    - should I buy this? YES
    - 399RMB
    - why I need a microwave?
      - you can use oven as microwave, but it's slow and waste more energy
      - if you have leftovers all the time, microwave is a must have
    - Do I need a steam oven? NO.
      - I searched profession chef youtubers, they don't use it.

  - a porriage pot, maybe a eletric one with timer?
  - current pot diameter: 22cm
- fruit basket: my current one is nice looking, but I am thinking, maybe I should switch to a big white bowl, when the current one is broken. Just like I may use a big bowl and not a vege drainer, just because, white bowl are simple and thus more versatile. I can use the bowl for noodles someday. And white bowls for everything also meaning less visual complexity for the rooms. Sometimes it's wise to stay simple and stupid.

- dish washing
  - 5 steps:
    - S0: Spary some diluted soap(pre-treating is key)
    - S1. cooking broom(first wave, with esay stain removed, now we see the hard clearly)
    - S2. use sth harder like Loofah Sponge, use soap if needed then rinse(second wave)
    - S3. Dish Towel (third wave, you dont want a small dishtowel https://youtu.be/_MUfq-M087M?list=WL&t=764)
    - S4. Clean Tools/CounterTop/Table.
  - cooking broom is nice, but I may consider this https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1bD4y1Q7BN?t=184
  - consider Ikea tartsmet brush https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.5-b-s.w4011-22402964982.141.2890a863LySWsv&id=610999436833&rn=e4480f0c94a5cdaf8028357c1184f76a&abbucket=15
  - for sponge, my current flat grup pad is actully recommended by 'clean my space' https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1gK411K73h/?spm_id_from=333.788.videocard.18
    - I may also need a brighter color one, it's esay to clean but mine still dirty visually
  - NOTE: these steps only works for 2-7 dishes case, if you have a lot of dish, add hot soapy water and drainage steps.
  - Tips: wash the cleanest first, like cups, then to plates, and wok/pan last. Have two dish towels and use them interchangeably, give one of them time to dry, otherwise they get smelly.

- socks hanger
  - same logic for socks as for clothes, when they gets dry, I can leave socks attached to the hanger, and put everything together in the socks storage box
  - MUST HAVES
    - be white, follow my design guideline
    - one clip for one sock
    - I don't want to hang each clip to the hanger one by one, that means the clips are tied to the hanger, but if it is really easy, that is OK.
    - the hanger will be small and light
    - not noisy, (metal hanger with 40 clips will be noisy)
    - small hook, or foldable, does take up lots of storage space
    - it's nice if the hanger itself is up in the air, when I clip the socks
      - if it is a big hanger with lots of clips, it's nice feature to be able to turn 
- rug
  - color
    - I need light gray https://youtu.be/T2tl4cJJWLg?t=449
  - has to be easy to clean with washing machine
  - a rug will make a room more homey
  - a failure
    - the rug delivered today was really beautil, dark and with beautiful curves
    - but it did it merge in my setting well, since my floor color is light, the rug really stood out
    - in comparison, my shelf and all the toys, looked so small and unimportant
    - so I returned the rug. 
    - if I really want a rug in the future, make it light wooden color.
    - the lesson: the living room is genral white background, and all the items are darker colors, so they stand out well, the logic is clear. so never buy big and outstanding things with unnessary deco-only curves or textures.
- curtain
  - how to join two poles together https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3ZopIwcI4w
  - tip: curtain width usually is 2 times the window width, because of the folds
  - given my hanger style, curtain max hright is 257cm(then it will reach the floor)
  - when I move the window size could be different, so not wise to buy a expensive curtain
    - besides, I don't want a blackout for my small room
    - and cat might ruin the sheers as well
  - what about a short curtain with height 180cm
    - table height: 75cm, this meanings the bottom of the curtain is a bit lower than my table top
    - my floor is really reflective, but since I am siting really close to the curtain, so I won't see the direct reflection of the winter sunshine
    - being short is being cat-safe
  - what about white thicken voile sheers for my bedroom?
    - the balcony has roof, so the sunshine won't be as strong as living room
