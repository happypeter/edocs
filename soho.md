title: My new home office setup
---

- camera
  - follow 董买买's strategy
- Table
  - I don't like the iron leg sharp edge desks now
  - round corner is nice
    - safe for 2 yo
    - comfortable when you touch it
  - I want wood workbench like my dinning table now
    - round corner, light, legs removable, so very portable
  - I don't want screws exposed outside, you can hide them easily
  - I want it to be versatile, so no drawers
    - Want shirt not strechers, so that people fill comfortable sitting on the side
    - that's maybe why most dinner tables don't need have strechers like desks
  - I want to use a dinner table as my desk
    - It's not uncommon to use dinner table as desk
      - https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/ikeas-melltorp-dining-table-is-120843
    - Cable organizers for USB cables.
      - If your desk is not too big, no need to worry about drilling a hole
  - my own table material: Scots pine
  - size
    - If u want to put on a big iMac 110x75cm is the minimum space
      - I already have two desks for iMac, so I don't need to worry about this
      - so I am OK with 100x60cm, it's also more than enough as a dinner table for four.
  
- sofa
  - modular and portable https://youtu.be/hgcTbLfChV4?t=680
- mirror
  - Nordic Style
- rent
  - can I rent a old apartment?
    - yes, the interior look does not matter, search '出租屋 改造‘ on youtube
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgcTbLfChV4
    - but, some requirements
      - soundproof windows/wall/door
      - proper heating
      - no furniture
      - sunshine
      - DIY tolerant landlord
      - you get the idea
    
  - repair the wall and lay the floor
    - https://youtu.be/hgcTbLfChV4?t=397
- Add a bit Unix Wisdom to the rooms
  - say consider each container as a folder, and tag names to it. e.g misc/ clothes/underwear/...

- colors
  - I will allow: black+gray+white+natrual wood color(from light brown to dark brown, then the doors maybe naturlly merged in)
    - If you ever hesitate, then the color should be white, cause it's should be as invisable as possible, other colors may look like a stain
  - all big items will be default to white/gray or a theme color
    - if I have to live in a brown-door apartment, maybe I show just use brown as theme color
      - https://youtu.be/a0mK0lXMMIc?t=794
    - by gray, I mean really black mixed with white color, no other colors
      - e.g https://youtu.be/Y9_ETrAR6BA?t=319 the sofa
    - I will be very picky with the colorwhen I have to buy somethings that is not black or white
  - every thing will be default to simple IKEA style design
  - all the tables/shelves should be white, cause the walls are white this could make them more invisible
    - therefore whatever you have on top of them become outstanding
    - photoframes then need to have darker color, this also obey the rules, cause a photo/poster is a item, not a background
  - theme color
    - use whatever color the roomdoors/closets of the apartment aleady have as theme color
    - people use some gray color as theme which looks really elegent

  - should I use theme color for a curtain, or can can I use black? Need to check some videos of house design
    - dark gray curtain looks great http://qinhuangdao.jiwu.com/info/6416306.html
  - need to train myself to be a pro house painter
  - it does not hurt to have brown color(as what most apartments tend to use for doors in Qinhuangdao)
    - as shown here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9_ETrAR6BA
  
- living room
  - clock is nice, but be sure to make it nose-less
- rooms by functions
  - I want a study room for myself
    - a single bed is enough for me.  
    - II want a small desk and chair in my room in case I need to work in my own room
  - a double bed in master bedroom for Elon and Billie
  - living room will be the main office
    - a bookshelf between my bench and Billie's to give a little privacy
  - dealing with heating radiator and the ugly half wooden walls?
    - P.S: the simple solution would be getting rid of the wood and paint the radiator white

- Kitchen
  - hide things to give a clean look from living room
    - build a tmp wall with my big white boxes, and hide things behind it
    - save thing behind the really wall
      - hang things on the wall
        - glue on the china tile wall: https://youtu.be/hcxro4ZTTmo?t=547
        - all I want is a flat board, wide enough, and hander down side: https://youtu.be/SYwhOAYYaJU?t=147
          - having a fence for the board is not a good idea, redundant and limiting the use case
  - Bowls and plates
    - maybe I need a plate rack like this https://youtu.be/a0mK0lXMMIc
    - The kitche looks really cluster and messy
      - Too many dark colors
      - bowls should be white to make it merge in the white wall, so that it can be invisable
    - I want a set of things
    - blowls should be easy to stack up
    - every thing should be as simple as possible
    - I think I shoud use white+silver for all small kitchen items
      - tissue paper container, bowls, plates, knife shelves, trash
      - If I have a big kitchen in the future, I can have some dark color items, but not now
 - If I am going to get spice rack: https://youtu.be/2_VDqSmVncI?t=653

- bedrooms
  - clothing organization
    - have a lot of hangers of different sizes, when the clothes are dry, put them in the closet together with the hanger
    - do the same to socks P.S I bought really special sock hangers
    - keep all socks same color same size, keep them in a special box once they are dry.
  - I do need a portable closet
    - for shoes and suits
    - and big luggage

- have shelf on wall without drilling: use 'hole panel'
  - https://youtu.be/a0mK0lXMMIc?t=310

- cable management
  - use 'hole panel' https://youtu.be/a0mK0lXMMIc?t=343
- cat 
  - cat's toliet https://youtu.be/S4et2vt2Ccg?t=921
- change Door color
  - use sth thick to cover the door with textures: https://youtu.be/ZIeLvU8FhbA?t=389
- if I need to seperate spaces
  - use '铁艺隔断’ iron room divider: https://youtu.be/Ou0Lp7UfNVw?t=129

- quilt
  - use '水洗棉' Washed cotton https://youtu.be/Ou0Lp7UfNVw?t=141
