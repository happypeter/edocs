title: My new home office design and implementation
---


## Design Guidelines
- LSRUD process for rental apartment
  - Layout: based on functionality
  - Style: choose the theme style
  - Renovation: walls and floors
  - Upcycle: make old item fit more in to the new design 
  - Deco: buy more little items
- being very minmum
  - for design
    - think IKEA
  - for functionailty
    - don't by things you don't need
    - things with least details, you will thank yourself when you try to clean them in the future
  - simpler means more versatile, you will upgrade your home over time 
    - a simple table will be easily use for other purpose, a desk with lots of details won't fit in your new home.
- everything portable
  - no damage to the walls
- be very modular
  - my big white boxes were great
    - remodel to a wall or closet or nightstand
    - good color fits into anyplace
  - I want a stronger version boxes
    - being strong to be the bottom of bed or sofa
    - I can use it as entryway stool
    - I want a new bed or sofa, all I need is a mat
    - maybe I can div with wood
      - Pingduoduo also have really nice PP boxes
      - heavy wood boxes with sharp coners are dangerour to put together, squeeze your fingers
      - without proper handle, wood boxes are not so portable
      - PP boxes are strong, light, and safe(pp also used for food packages)
    - a single bed is usually 120x200cm
      - I want four boxes a single bed, so one box is 60x100cm
    
- slightly different design for different rooms
  - the bedrooms should be more homey
  - the living room more open and colorful, like a google office
- Add a bit Unix Wisdom to the rooms
  - say consider each container as a folder, and tag names to it. e.g misc/ clothes/underwear/...
- have posters of github/google/code/editors , the theme is Coder's Home.

## DIY Tricks
- Painting
  - https://youtu.be/tA7B0lN4vWY?t=82
  - cover surface around paiting area with 美纹纸
  - paint paper with 丙烯 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08rmUPh9DtA
  - for broken white wall, use spray paint
- mounting
  - 热熔胶 for things

## Rent consideration
  - can I rent a old apartment?
    - yes, the interior look does not matter, search '出租屋 改造‘ on youtube
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgcTbLfChV4
    - but, some requirements
      - soundproof windows/wall/door
      - proper heating
      - no furniture
      - sunshine
      - DIY tolerant landlord
      - you get the idea
  - repair the wall and lay the floor
    - https://youtu.be/hgcTbLfChV4?t=397

## Style
- palette
  - black + white + pure-gray + light-wooden + bright-google-office-colors
    - this palette should be very tolerant to any other colors too I believe, especially when it's light
    - sliver and brown door color are toleranted
    - netrual color or cartoon-ish bright saturated color?
      - quick answer: I will strive for bright ones.
      - large items with bright color tend to look cheap, so do I need some more neutral colors for chairs and things? EC life's demo of black-white-gray theme  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LxU5AaCl-M , see the chair here, a netrual color. However, I don't beleive I am professional enough to control netural colors
        - It's really hard to get the combination right, even using different tones of grays
        - besides, I am a engineer, I love simplicity

- EC life's 3-color rule trick https://youtu.be/O7sx0dZv7To?t=163
    - no more than 3 colors, 60%-30%-10%
- shopping guideline
  - if I ever need to buy something, make it NO.1 white or NO.2 bright colors, NO.3 black NO.4 gray(pure black + white)
    - If you ever hesitate, then the color should be white, cause it's should be as invisable as possible, other colors may look like a stain
    - really small item, really doesn't matter, sometime bright colors looks cheap, 
    - big things like a kettle, use bright color, or white or sliver.
  - many things go well with black+white theme
    - https://youtu.be/NMsDFycKvIw?t=8 wooden things, flowers, leaves
  - all the tables/shelves should be white, cause the walls are white this could make them more invisible
    - therefore whatever you have on top of them become outstanding
    - photoframes then need to have darker color, this also obey the rules, cause a photo/poster is a item, not a background
  - simple shape
    - also, I want to keep things really cartoon-ish, try to aviod things with too much details
- why I don't have a theme color
  - having a theme color have two benefits
    - NO.1 set the tone for the home
    - NO.2 unify different rooms
  - but for now I prefer not to have a theme color
    - since I have the door-brown in everyroom to unify all rooms
      - there is a way to fix the color easily https://youtu.be/D5Dr3qrDDtA?t=610
    - but I don't design for the door-brown color, it is not my theme color

## Rooms 
- living room
  - clock is nice, but be sure to make it nose-less
- my bed room
  - will be my work room too
- kitchen
- bathroom

## Kitchen
- a framed poster for power switch panel
  - panel size: 44x28cm
  - DIY the poster with markers
    - featuring Github or Google, wikipedia
- bowl rack
  - https://youtu.be/0WIipdQNipQ?t=716
  - maybe I need a plate rack like this https://youtu.be/a0mK0lXMMIc
  - the table top is precious, try to hang things on the wall
    - wall lid stand
- hide things to give a clean look from living room
  - build a tmp wall with my big white boxes, and hide things behind it
  - save thing behind the really wall
      - hang things on the wall
      - glue on the china tile wall: https://youtu.be/hcxro4ZTTmo?t=547
      - all I want is a board wide enough, and hander down side: https://youtu.be/SYwhOAYYaJU?t=147
- layout
  - cutting board and oil should be placed as near to the stoves as reasonably practicable
  - ladle and spatula shall be hung next to wok, not the other side of the stove
    - sometimes they are drippling, I don't want to carry it a long way to somewhere
    - during the process of cooking, they should be hung there and I don't need to worry about the drippling, the table top is waterproof anyway.
- The kitche looks really clustered and dirty
  - how to look clean
    - white items on darkbackground, black items on white backgroud, see EC life's bathroom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeQjx8Kj0Bs
      - the kitchen window and closet are both dark, so items should be white
        - white bowels plates and things
      - will use black shelf on white tile wall
  - how to look more organized
    - I want a set of things(bottles tupperwares bowls and plates)

## Living Room
- four boxes = a sofa or bed
  - if I need more boxes, pick a set
- plants
  - https://youtu.be/0owW3UgDX0I?t=308
  - To have Nordic style https://youtu.be/tA7B0lN4vWY?t=166
- big desk size 110x220cm
- billie's desk 160x80cm
- main area size 358x458cm
- most wall 28cm
- window 195cm

## My Bedroom
- rug
  - color
    - dark, really dark, as a backgroud of my light color items
    - round shape on it, since I have too much rectangular thing
    - tolerant of dirt or cat's fur
    - dark floor and rug will make your room look even brighter
  - size: enough for yoga
  - has to be easy to clean with washing machine
  - a rug will make a room more homey
- sizes
 - floor to ceiling height 267cm
 - floor width: 272cm floor length: 420cm
 - balcony entrency width: 172cm height: 233cm
- a curtain:
  - tip: curtain width usually is 2 times the window width, because of the folds
  - given my hanger style, curtain max hright is 257cm(then it will reach the floor)
  - when I move the window size could be different, so not wise to buy a expensive curtain
    - besides, I don't want a blackout for my small room
    - and cat might ruin the sheers as well
  - what about a short curtain with height 180cm
    - table height: 75cm, this meanings the bottom of the curtain is a bit lower than my table top
    - my floor is really reflective, but since I am siting really close to the curtain, so I won't see the direct reflection of the winter sunshine
    - being short is being cat-safe
  - what about white thicken voile sheers for my bedroom?
    - the balcony has roof, so the sunshine won't be as strong as living room
    - this is nordic style, love the demo videos on Pingduoduo
- quilt
  - use '水洗棉' Washed cotton https://youtu.be/Ou0Lp7UfNVw?t=141
- nightstand TODO
  - my bed takes all the room, so I need a hole board between bed and wall
    - I need to be able to put cellphone
  - If it's just my phone, can I simply use a soft-box instead?
- table side cabinet
  - use a small hole board instead maybe: https://youtu.be/O7sx0dZv7To?t=525
- bed 
  - a large white cloth to cover all my bed
  - bed skirt, mattress, back
    - maybe same color?
    - grey is a good color
      - https://southshorefinelinens.com/blogs/southshoreblog/does-my-bed-need-a-bed-skirt
- clothing organization
  - have a lot of hangers of different sizes, when the clothes are dry, put them in the closet together with the hanger
  - do the same to socks P.S I bought really special sock hangers
  - keep all socks same color same size, keep them in a special box once they are dry.
- I do need a portable closet TODO
  - currently not enough place to hang clothes
  - for shoes and suits
  - and big luggage

## Cat's Home
  - does not have to be ugly https://www.midwesthomes4pets.com/
  - cat litter box (if I ever need one)
    - https://youtu.be/BBU4xkklIg4?t=241

## Bathroom
  - Just follow EC life https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeQjx8Kj0Bs
  - towel management
    - requirements:
      - one of my towels will be completely wet daily, so I do need a place on balcony
      - I don't want to hang them all the day on the master hanger
    - Plan Discussions
      - PlanA: a freestand for the towels
        - I can put my nail cutter in the stand
        - Benifits
          - I can keep my nail cutter and foot towel all under the sunshine
        - problems:
          - one more permenant(and not relly pleasant) thing within my daily sight
      - PlanB: change my hanbit, don't make it wet everyday
        - keep towels in use in the bathroom
      - problem
        - no seperation between toliet and washing bowl, so no way to stop the smell
     - Solution:
       - go PlanB
       - only have one or two landary days per week, so that we enjoy a clean balcony for most time
       - buy more towels, save the dirty ones, wash them and hang them with other clothes
       - all towels purchursed in the future will be white
       - levelup the cleanliness standard for my bathroom
       - fragrance for bathroom

## Furnitures
- camera
  - follow 董买买's strategy
- Table
  - I don't like the iron leg sharp edge desks now
  - round corner is nice
    - safe for 2 yo
    - comfortable when you touch it
  - I want wood workbench like my dinning table now
    - round corner, light, legs removable, so very portable
  - I don't want screws exposed outside, you can hide them easily
  - I want it to be versatile, so no drawers
    - Want shirt not strechers, so that people fill comfortable sitting on the side
    - that's maybe why most dinner tables don't need have strechers like desks
  - I want to use a dinner table as my desk
    - It's not uncommon to use dinner table as desk
      - https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/ikeas-melltorp-dining-table-is-120843
    - Cable organizers for USB cables.
      - If your desk is not too big, no need to worry about drilling a hole
  - my own table material: Scots pine
  - size
    - If u want to put on a big iMac 110x75cm is the minimum space
      - I already have two desks for iMac, so I don't need to worry about this
      - so I am OK with 100x60cm, it's also more than enough as a dinner table for four.
- sofa
  - modular and portable, four boxs a big sofa
- mirror
  - Nordic Style

## Misc
- have shelf on wall without drilling: use 'hole panel'
