  - spary some water, wait before the water is totally dry to paint

- toliet needs to stay in it's own room
  - not together with anything, not shower, not washing machine
  - needs a powerful sparyer for its own
- wet and dry zone
  - shower is definetly wet zone, so requires its own drain and floor water barrier
- why not a all-in-one portable prefabricated toliet unit?
  - the floor is above the room floor, not safe when floor is wet
  - I don't think I need a door for the toliet
  - I want to share a exhaust fan with shower
    - MasterLi: hide the fan behind plasterboard(Chinese drywell, 石膏板), drill a hole on the wall, share the hole with drainline venting
  - so some simple half-transparent 1.5m glass screen will do
  - I will build everything(shower/toliet) right on the floor and use black frame glass as seperators
- wall hung vanity
  - just a small basin, no need for extra space, otherwise more clean work
  - no drawer or cabinet needed, install floating shelves on the side
- hang everything
- vent

  - install a exhaust fan https://youtu.be/AXP4uhIbmyQ?t=806

- mop
  - old style string mob and a platic bucket to take every where.
  - don't build fixed basin for mop, it is not safe enough.
