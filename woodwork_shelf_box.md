  - MY DESIGN
    - use my 83x8x8 lumber and 25mm steel pipe
      - use 3 pipes on each lumber, each at 13cm, 43cm, 73cm from the top
      - each lumber is 50cm away from the next, so the shelf would be 2m long
      - 2m long 3 layer shelf

    - 3inch deep into the wood
  - lumber storage should be far from your bench

- big things go to crates

  - e.g when I want to put away my nailers, I can use a crate, and nest small boxes in it for nails and other small parts. 
- small things build with 18cm plywood(as frame) plus mdf or thin 8cm plywood (as walls)
- first project should be a box for my grinder accessories
