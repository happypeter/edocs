   *     - instead of a heavy duty bench, I will prefer a more portable/sacrificial sawhorse thing
   *   - this needs to be small and easy to build
   * - a serious barn
   *   - local code does not allow two storey buildings
   *   - I don't need big house to make a nice farm https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48GzbNGoF90
   *   - smaller, simple structures makes it a lot easier to reuse lumbers when I need to move
   *   - lesson I learnt is that I need a tool shed before I build this
   *   - two wing structure @10min_barn https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovXWjuvWJCo
   * - a deck and farmhouse table
   *   - https://youtu.be/kKYS0dPIfr4?t=87
