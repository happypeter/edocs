  - 1. copy chinese in to google to get english version
  - 2. fix mistakes, use google search and youglish to make sure the phrases

  - 3. read the whole paragraph to be sure it's really undertandable
  - 4. paste the text to grammerly to catch some typo or grammer mistakes.
  - 5. delete the chinese in the file, make sure you do the who translation in
       one go, coming back to check it again is a too time consuming.
