/**
 * - goals
 *   - vlog_tip: show people the end result, and explain the goals
 *   - weather proof
 *   - a openable roof
 *   - wire inside, so that rabit wont chew on the wood https://youtu.be/6nN3vSnYPzM?t=897
 *   - all wire floor, no wood at all, easy to be kept clean
 *     - the support needs to be strong and paint, meal? so that sparyable
 *   - a bit distance from ground, so that I can easily get the poop out https://youtu.be/6nN3vSnYPzM?t=1068
 *   - stick supportable roof https://youtu.be/6nN3vSnYPzM?t=184
 *   - sheathed plywood wall room on west side to shade away hot setting sun
 *   - a hey station: https://youtu.be/6nN3vSnYPzM?t=647
 * 
 * - material collection
 *   - vlog_tip: tell the audience this is the step I do, but don't introduce things in detail
 *   - faced plywood
 * - design
 *   - a simple plan drawing for myself
 *   - mostly replic this 
 *     - the structure not strong shear force https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgaE1R5IJQI
       - https://youtu.be/6nN3vSnYPzM?t=1067
 *       - use plywood cover half of the structure to provide shear strength 
 *   - course_tip: don't explain it too much to the audience, cause things will get clear along building
 * - process 
 * - Next Version aka. v2
 *   - plan, my porcreate App, RabbitHutchV2
  * - wire cloth
  *   - the one I got is 1mm thick with 2cm holes, I will prefer 1.5mm thick and 1.5cm holes for my next version of this
  *   - for the floor, PVC coat wire mesh is prefered to avoid foot sores
  * - depth
  *   - is now 60cm, I will make it 70cm next version
  * - roof
  *   - I will use sheet metal roof, but add a big handle infront, and maybe some wood corners to hide the dark edges
  *     - https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FQIKcTCORrM
  *   - flatter roof, so that I don't need to cut angles for roof frame
  * - floor
  *   - thick wire flooring https://youtu.be/6nN3vSnYPzM?t=383
  *     - throw hardwareCloth+mat, embrace tougher wire bottom floor
  *     - 1cmx1.5cm holes
  *     - 14 gauge(1.6mm) wire 
 *
