## Marathon Tips

- carb loading before race
- the secret sauce is Always try to keep a steady pace.
  - Changing speed is a big mistake, from my own experience
  - Even in the first 10km, you really want to be faster, and the last 10km, you really want to slow down
    - don't do it
  - 5:30/km is my platform
