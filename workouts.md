## Marathon Tips
- 60g carb per hr for endurance sports
- salt tablet
  - 飞燕 said she took 2-6 for the whole race
  - my friend 涂涂 suggested I took 8 tablets
- energy gels
  - it is better than neakers in that it does not put a lot pressure on your stomach, for me this matters.
  - a side benefit is that you don't need to beg for sports drink at charging stations, you can always go for water.
  - But as energy gels are condensed sports drink, taking them together puts you at risk of taking on too much sugar at once. 
  - can I use snickers instead?
    - it is actually recommended https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE-OMNPCpoY
      - because it is highly concentrated, gels cause tummy upset easily
    - snickers are once called marathon bars.
    - peanut butter is actully very good food for long runners, since it provice the feeling of fullness.
    - There are people who eats chocalte wrapped peanuts during running
    - peanut give the same fullness feeling, but they stay in your stomach longer, which maybe good for you, or maybe it's bad cause it may upset your stomach, but gels can also upset some people's stomach, so do whatever works for you.
- carb loading before race
- The perfect time to take an energy gels depends on you and your body. Every runner absorbs and processes carbohydrates at a different rate; some can feel the effect within 3 minutes while for others it might take up to 15 minutes.
- As your body diverts blood away from your stomach towards your active muscles, your absorption rate slows, or sometimes your stomach shuts down completely; this is most common cause for unwanted toilets stops during a run.
- As your digestion process slows during your run, it’s important not to overload your stomach. Wait around 45-60 minutes between gels, or around 6-7 miles to ensure you don’t intake too much simple sugar at once. Consider alternating between caffeine and non-caffeine energy gels too to ensure you don’t take on too much caffeine. 
- the secret sauce is Always try to keep a steady pace.
  - Changing speed is a big mistake, from my own experience
  - Even in the first 10km, you really want to be faster, and the last 10km, you really want to slow down
    - don't do it
  - 5:30/km is my platform
- Salt Pills
  - Less encouraged nowadays, casue sports drinks also contains sodium
  - https://www.snackinginsneakers.com/salt-tablets-for-runners/
    - sports drinks provide two things: fuel and sodium
  -  runners can lose approximately 3,000 milligrams(sodium) in a one hour run. So this is where salt pills come in.
- don't eat too much the night before, bad for sleeping.
  - eat fruits minimumly
- get bread and pickled vege for breakfast
- the second half should be faster than your first half, that is the right way to do marathon.
- I will try follow the 300 rabbit(pacesetter).
  - I am feeling my pace is at 5'20, but no pacer for this.
