  - need a console table placed on the side of my shop to hold this saw

- Do I really need a track saw?
  - won't a simple circular saw guide do?
  - it is my miter saw with more range, and table saw with less noise and danger

  - a guide is good for halfing big boards
  - the track saw is here for precise and quick cuts for boards under 1m
