   * - goals
   *   - a wood storage rack with a roof
   *   - no walls needed
   *   - I do need a leveled floor
   *   - shelves
   *   - a T-shed with rack, with a room goes in the middle, https://happypeter.github.io/githome/imgs/20250209/
   * - process
   *   - it's mostly a pole-barn structure, but I don't have posts buried in solid
   *   - posts are just free standing on a brick, or just on ground
   *   - so I need to rely on the sturcuture itself to give enough strength, so that the shed won't rack or fall
   *   - the idea is set 4 posts, with both top ends of south wall on same level, and north wall same way, when you build on a uneven ground, this step takes time
   *   - then you start to set floor beams that level, and together with the beams of loft floor, a true cubic shape is formed
   *   - make sure the floor beams and top beams are strong and wide, cause they are what future braces will be attached to
   *   - however, floor/loft beams only go for side wall bracing, what can I do for front and back wall
   *   - for a ordinary shed, when you have sheathing done, the structure will be secured, but for my design here, I need some beam-ish, super strong girts, that are tightly atacched to beams, so that I can brace on

   * and in the video, there is also the NO-Math shed building method, which might be the easiest shed ever.
