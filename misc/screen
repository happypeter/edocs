Ctrl-w-o " your window layout will all gone, if you don't want this, use Ctrl-w-K, Ctrl-w-H ...
Ctrl-w-c to close the window, but I ususally do `,bd`
Window is not buffer, it is just view of the buffer, you delete the window the buffer will still there.
So, you can also view the same buffer in 2 windows
in Notepad, buffer and window is the same.


# watchout for your mapings
if you already have `,a` never use `,ax` to map sth else, cause then there will be a delay when you use `,a`
