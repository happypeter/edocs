just open the gui config window, and type everything as you do in windows
and then reboot your machine, done
and this does not matter:

    peter@vostro:~/repo-farm/hen$ ifup eth0
    ifup: couldn't read interfaces file "/etc/network/interfaces"

there is a port named *WAN*
you nust plug the *input* cable into this port.
and there is also a led for this, if it is off, that means you wan input is down
then my laptop shows me the connection is active, but this only means it connected well with the router, since the *wan* is not connected well to the router, so there is no way to visit www with my laptop now

in ubuntu 10.04 and 9.10 :

basiclly all I did was to follow the instruction of the `pppoeconf` command

all it takes are the *userID* and *PassWord*
other things are all defauted.

$pon dsl-provider

if things are not valid, try above command to restart the service.

I know *pppoe* is in use by checking the configrations in Windows.

今天又上不去网了，给人家打电话（张永健，这边的维修经理：18603367758）说先让我看灯，我说光纤盒子上：power pon lan 三个灯都亮，那人家说线路肯定没问题。让我不用路由器直接连 windows 拨一下号，如果报 691 错误，就是欠费了，试了一下，果然。
