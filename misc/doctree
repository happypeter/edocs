I think my day-to-day doc can grow this way:

1.	first we have one file named wiki
2.	when we have too many topics in wiki, we make it a dir
3.	and divide some big topics in to each own file
4.	when the same happens to one of these files, we make it a dir as well
5.	just keep going this way, my doc actually grow like a tree.
- say we have a `vi/`, when we have some small and unorgnized tricks, we put it
into `vi/misc`, when some topic is `misc` gets big enough, we port it out to its own file. that is still the *tree* logic obvious.

so we can 

1.	use markdown format, because muse is too complex, and we must have a format
2.	so we have folders and subfolders, we will generate them into index pages
3.	anyway just let things grow organically.
4.	so we can covert all the markdown files into htmls, though they are not interconnected, but things are clear in a TREE way

wow, this is really cool, as natural as nature.

NOTE: actually we can use some markdown syntax as I like, but we do not have to.
with my knowledge on vim grows, I feel I can manipulate contents more efficiently in text more rather than with in firefox. so exporting things into html is now for me now so important. vim can also do hyper link and indexing and all good things I really need, and it is really stupid to try to do things more quickly with mouse.
