my big idea now is to do everything without mouse.

basiclly go system->pref->keyboard shortcut

I love Alt+F9 Alt+tab Alt+F10

and Alt+F7+up|down to move window is also nice
## user
System>Admin>Users and groups
## startup

	peter@cow:~$ cat /bin/ggg
	gnome-terminal --full-screen --hide-menubar

## shutcut 

	Alt + F2---Displays the Run Application dialog. 
	Alt + Print Screen----Takes a screenshot of the window that has focus. 

	Alt + Tab  
	Alt + Esc  
	Ctrl + Alt + left arrow  

## sound

system->preference->sound->alert valum-->mute

this seems to be only available start from 9.10
