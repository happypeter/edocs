 /*
 now I feel strongly that, for a desk, use drawers, e.g. IKEA alex, as support is a big win
 - NO.1 you want to make use of the space under the table, hey it is not a dinner table that you need the space for human legs
 - NO.2 more stable support than legs, you need very tough legs(if without apron), if you build that will wood, not very good use of space
   - I'd rather have one side with drawers, another with thinner legs to give the space more airy vibe.
   - sth like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dWzupkBcNU
 - NO.3 you don't need apron to support the top, if you have two wide drawer units supporting it

 - apron
   - one tall board mounted on the drawer and shelf at each end, like this https://youtu.be/76cZZseMgHw?t=11
   - hide wires and power/usb outlets, behind that

- drawer/shelf depth
  - tabletop is 75
  - the depth for drawer container should be at least 65cm
    -  if each drawer does not need to go that deep, the left space can be used to hide away things
       - like powerOutlets/wifiRouter
