- v1(diy version) problems
  - the poor 30cm range is the biggest flaw
    - if I have a >30cm wide board with one side curved, I can not even fix it
    - now I have 1.22x1.22m plywood, how can I get a 40x122cm board?
- products
  - 洛克士 8inch https://item.jd.com/72335069241.html#comment
    - range: 62cm/7.5cm 
- checklist
  - range 60cm/4cm
    - I don't want 120cm range, because too much extended table will be cut error larger than skil saw 
    - extention table https://theweekendwoodworker.com/tww-tool-list-thank-you-cc/
  - router 
    - router is more versatile than dado cutting https://theweekendwoodworker.com/tww-tool-list-thank-you-cc/
  - 45degree cut


- kickbacks
  - When I cut plywood without jig
    - kickback happened for no clear reason
    - wood hit my belly, but caused no injury
    - so as long as I give a downward force for the workpiece
      - don't let the wood fly up, I shall be OK
      - cause I am short, my penis was way below the saw blade
  - https://youtu.be/6zLdB3zil_E?t=51
    - two lessons:
      - push stick should be tall
      - always have the piece between black and fence under your push stick
  - https://youtu.be/eUx8oTIALmg?t=385
    - lesson: control the work piece until it leaves the blade conpletely. If this guy used a push stick to give a downward force to the wood, these would not have happened.
  - to aviod kickback, mesuare the angel of the blade and table surface to make sure it is 90degree, and make sure the fence and the blade is in perfect parallel

  - riving knife
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haYWxqjss_g
    - even pros dont always use it https://youtu.be/S9PTFizoA64?t=55
    - my cicular saw can not install riving knife, but as long as I don't use rip fence to do cross-cut, I will be OK https://youtu.be/tKtE0sTFi8g?t=634
  - kickbacks can be horrible https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUx8oTIALmg
    - that is why your riving knife is necessary https://youtu.be/eUx8oTIALmg?t=541
    - and your push stick can also give you extra protect, even the kickback happens
    - your body out of the kickback path, like this https://youtu.be/un2YUPlgh8c?t=214
  - don't use table saw to cut small things
    - things will fly, and your hands may get too close to the saw
    - never cut narrow things like this piece https://youtu.be/eUx8oTIALmg?t=1469
      - https://youtu.be/tKtE0sTFi8g?t=630
      - use miter saw  
      - or use you miter guage https://youtu.be/JOhZxvgkWNM?t=346
        - people call this case 'cross cut', and 'don't use your fence when cross cuting'
  - don't fasten the nut too much https://youtu.be/JOhZxvgkWNM?t=336
  - place the push stick close to the blade, not the fence
    - https://youtu.be/eUx8oTIALmg?t=1635
      - in the video's case, if your wood is not very small, and you have riving knife in place, you should not have this problem
    - the idea is aviod rotation of the wood by all means
    - this is actully a very important tip, knowing this free u to buy this https://youtu.be/hRygWpXXYJ4?t=86
  - how to do a cut
    - https://youtu.be/tKtE0sTFi8g?t=727
    - eyes on the fence, not the blade
    - one hand push forward, the other push wood downward to the table and against the fence
    - when the cut is done, push the piece(especially the work piece, because your cut-off piece is always on the left side of the blade) off the blade
  - a insert plate is necessary
    - https://youtu.be/tKtE0sTFi8g?t=284
  - d on't use miter guage and rip fence together https://youtu.be/tKtE0sTFi8g?t=368
  - push the wood to the fence, give it a trend to leave the blade https://youtu.be/5ADbrYJtDP8?t=208
  - don't leave the smaller part between the blade and fence https://youtu.be/5ADbrYJtDP8?t=234
    - two reasons: 1. small things fly esaily, 2. kickbacks do not happen on the oppsite side of the fence
  - what is a kickback https://youtu.be/5ADbrYJtDP8?t=184


- bench 
  - general look
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAEykXezb6I
  - frame
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHIe9VSikbA
      - all the aprons and legs should be kept perfectly 90degree against table top
        - this is the one single point to focus on when you assemble the table
        - foucing on two many metrics, makes the work very hard to finish
          - some numbers are not that useful, since the pieces are not always perfectly cut
        - before drilling for screws, do use clamps
      - follow the video, use 40x70 to get a perfect 800x600 squere
      - then at this point https://youtu.be/mHIe9VSikbA?t=110
        - I don't have that long screws, so I will use some wood triangles to fasten the table top, of course, not screws shown on the table up
      - then at https://youtu.be/mHIe9VSikbA?t=128
        - same problem, no long enough screws
        - I will use plywood as sidestrechers, as https://youtu.be/vqFIDi0QqhM?t=466


- why not diy with skil saw?
  - not hard to build fence/miterSlot
    - problem is they are hard to use
    - I actually build many features myself, it is suprising that nothing really worked
      - the rip fence had not precision
      - the miter sled, that did not slide at all
      - the range is limited to 30cm
