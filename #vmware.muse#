1.install gcc in order to compile VMware modules

$ sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential gcc-3.4

2.

$ tar zxvf VMware-workstation-6.0.2-59824.i386.tar.gz

3. run install script

$ export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-3.4 && cd vmware-distrib && sudo ./vmware-install.pl

peter: soon i see this

Your kernel was built with "gcc" version "4.2.3", while you are trying to use 
"/usr/bin/gcc" version "4.2.4". This configuration is not recommended and 
VMware Workstation may crash if you'll continue. Please try to use exactly same
compiler as one used for building your kernel. Do you want to go with compiler 
"/usr/bin/gcc" version "4.2.4" anyway? [no] 

peter: but i just type y and skip this, i am not sure it is 3.4 or 4.2.4 that is in use
maybe it is using $CC------3.4, cause i see "use CC" in the dubug message


4. when asked whether you want to run /usr/bin/vmware-config.pl, please selcet no, otherwise you see the following error:

make[2]: *** [/tmp/vmware-config0/vmmon-only/linux/driver.o] Error 1

make[1]: *** [_module_/tmp/vmware-config0/vmmon-only] Error 2

make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.24-2-generic'

make: *** [vmmon.ko] Error 2

make: Leaving directory `/tmp/vmware-config0/vmmon-only'

Unable to build the vmmon module.

5. donload VMware-any-any-update, this patch is suitable for both VMware Server and VMware Workstation 

then 

shell$ sudo tar zxvf vmware-any-any-update-116.tgz

shell$ sudo cd vmware-any-any-update116/

shell$ sudo ./runme.pl

peter: runme.pl will run vmware-config.pl automatically
