This guy really invent his own tags, similar to wiki, e.g
{{{
==How Does It Work?|how-does-it-work==
}}}
but I do not see a point for this.
why just use some mainline wiki format, though it might take a bit longer to
write, but there are wiki viewer and editor there which bring lots of convinience.
