  - hand sketching the design https://youtu.be/wcn5ayESWLs?t=64

  - plainText first
    - I don't like GUI things, 3d software is just another one of these
    - I love markdown, I love css
      - since I can render html if I need
        - As to my woodwork, I want to just keep every detail in code
        - When I need to render my project, I render it with wood to real world
          - So if in the future, I want to upgrade my design
          - I can take a peek at the photo(or real object) of my desgin
          - if 3d design file is for the sake of quickly get the idea of what you are going to build
            - I think .jpg file will also do the job
      - I can versionControl/Global them,
    - engineering is all about iteratons
      - A .skp file is not git friendly
      - to build sth(woodwork or device development), there is a lot more than just shapes
        - materials/workflow/watchouts/tests(think unitTest & IntegrationTest)/
        - everything will be much more managable(esay to update/modularize)
          - in a 0 redundant way
          - sketchup also has Components
            - but can you pass parameters to it
            - once you make one Unique, can you change it along with its slibings
              - since shapes are not easily searchable
              - so use 3d files to manage a complicated project will not be doable
    - a 3d design file is a image
      - image is good at two things:
        - giving you lots of details
        - help you grasp the main idea in 1 sec
      - but when you want to failFast/moveFast, 99% details does not actually matter, so I use img for the seond reason
      - to use plainText to decrible HowToBuildATable
        - you only document what matters, and iterate over them
        - I can enjoy doing whatever I like when I build the part not covered by code         
    - PlainText is good
      - If I want a cutList, I can just use a array
        - Why use a graph? GUI things is mainly for the bosses or the customer
