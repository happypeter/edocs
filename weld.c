  - should I buy one just for stickWelding or allInOne?
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUZkeYFOu1E
    - you can buy machine than does both MIG and Stick 
      - PDD: 不用气的二保焊机
    - I will first rule out all methods with GasProtection
      - hard to buy the gas
      - but I do want a machine that works with wider range of thickness
        - even though without Gas, the result will be uglier, even you use thin wire(the MIG-ish way)
  - stick machine is cheap
    - should work for 1.5mm or thicker
  - tig 氩弧焊 needs a gas tank, less portable
    - the skill is harder to learn https://youtu.be/OWThL97tq3k?t=134
    - prettier result, and for thinner targets
      - just melt the metals and fuse them together, no intermidiary metal needed
    - MIG also needs a gas tank, but it use a feed wire
      - so it's easier than TIG, and less quality
    - it is a subtype of Gas metal arc welding 气保焊
      - 二保焊 is also a subtype, the gas is CO2, hence the name
