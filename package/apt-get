People say aptitude has better dependency tracking than apt-get, can not believe it!!
## download deb

	sudo apt-get source network-manager --compile

try to download deb with this, but failed for build dependency check. intalled `dpkg-dev`
but not all deps are satisfied. 

but I can find url in /etc/apt/sources.list, and get it by

    firefox http://cn.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/x/xorg/

    
## uninstall packages

    apt-get purge vim-core
 
## get exact package name
    
    pet@cow:~$ dpkg-query -l|grep emacs
    
    pet@cow:~$ dpkg-query -L emacs-goodies-el|grep colo
    /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/emacs-goodies-el/color-theme.el
    pet@cow:~$ 
    

## dep error

some times:

    failed deps: bar1.1 is reuiquied by bar1.2 is to be installed

this is simplely because you are now have a higher version than what is depended on.
the fix:
    
    aptitude purge bar

then things shall work.
