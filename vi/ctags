 open the tags file and i see the format is basiclly

    tagName <which file it belongs> <the line of the defination in this file>
<the type of this tag: f--function m--memner... see "$ ctags
--list-kinds|less" for more> <the class it belongs>


## how to start my work in a whole new way

I used to start coding by open a file I want to edit
but now I know it is simply better, to start by a tag,
I can use

    vim -t tag

but for most case, I just can not type the tag name correctly
so my current method is to open the *tags*(genetated by ctags) with vim first
then I can use <C-]> to jump to the location and start my work,
this is not good, since the *tags* file itself is not good to read, messy. SO
the better solution shall be use Taglist to have all symbols in its window,
nuch nicer looking, but how to do it?

## python 
billie@billie-desktop:~/ddd$ tree
.
|-- hello.py
|-- main.py
|-- tags
`-- xx
    |-- __init__.py
    `-- sub.py

1 directory, 5 files
billie@billie-desktop:~/ddd$ history |grep xargs
  338  find . -name "*.py"|xargs ctags

use above and then "Ctr+]" to find definition of a fuction, and use it the same time will cscope
