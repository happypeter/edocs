if you want want know how vim formatting works, check
    :h gq
and it is basically to do the *fo* setting with

	:set fo=croq

the above seting is mainly for c Comments.

I use VISUAL LINE to select the text, and then run gq, simple

if I want to edit wikiwikiweb with vim. I need to 

    :set paste

this will skip whatever you set in *fo* and paste stuff with its format unchanged
