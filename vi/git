every time I want to do a git commit, I always run git diff to check what I've
done to the current repo first, that is nice, since you get a last minuite
check of the current repo, and makes you feel safe to do the commit.

and everytime I modify and file, I change the buffer, but when I try to write
my modification to the original file, I do not know how to have the
last-minuite check of what I am going to save, that is bad. Now  I know all I
need to do is to make a vimdiff between the buffer and the file on the disk,
this is not so hard I think.

since the output of vimdiff is much nice than that of gitdiff, so I will try
to integrate git into vim
