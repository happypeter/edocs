  - being on a shelf is nice, since it makes the floor easy to clean
    - but will I left the floor empty?
      - 100% not, because agin my space is limited
      - it's very likely I will put some boxes on the floor under the shelf
        - if the boxes have no casters, that's means to floor is hard to clean 
        - if I want casters, why not build a shelf on casters?
          - so that is a cart!
- so I want a cart, above the cart, I can still do shelves, for lumber or anything
- for future useful cut-offs, you stack them, not bury them in trash
