## Work bench
- my plan
  - thinking of using this top board for my bench
    - https://youtu.be/UlElSbqD3jc?t=604
    - the board with extend outside the box, so it is clampable
    - you can drill dogholes and add tail vise to it
  - layer the bed to make it a 85cm or so bench
  - add my vise(bench screw pilers) to it
  - host my miter saw
  - benchtop clamp
    - this is alailable cheap on PDD https://youtu.be/yGgNvV1_3hQ?t=1274
  - own a 75x190cm workbench is nothing portable
    - it is actully a feature, not a bug, since you never want your bench move and bump while you work
      - this size also make ripping 120x240board easy
    - but still you can make it mudular by making parts easily attachable
  - try to make it clampable
    - at least part of the bench https://youtu.be/UlElSbqD3jc?t=961
    - I need clamps like this, so that I can use my planer https://youtu.be/VWgGZ4Osg1U?t=126

- my bench top
  - the tail part, which I want it thick, area 74x66cm
  - glue up two layer of plywood, than stain it, and drill dogholes

    - or https://youtu.be/53PrmkFpdI0?t=1698
- secure/fasten workpiece
  - best solution:
    - dog hole + wood vise https://youtu.be/mHIe9VSikbA?t=516
      - install at front corner is better https://youtu.be/UlElSbqD3jc?t=618
        - since I can use hand saw here
  - fasten a sheet to sand, with dog holes
