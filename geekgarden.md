NOTE: foucsing on things big and hard that I can not take away, while [soho](soho.md) for the lighter & portable.

- design guideline
  - Keyword: standard
    - All the material must be easy and cheap to buy, say I will use concrete to build my sideway, rather than old bricks from old building. 
    - Every detail shoud be easily documentable, and every detail is there for a reason, form follows functionality. No fancy tricks for my tempeorary aesthetic taste.
    - the whole design must be very portable to another old country homestead.
    - standardization is a prerequisite for automation
    - think in system, e.g every part of the building should follow the same exterior design and palette.
- the name
  - the homestead will look techy, demostrate ideas like industrilization and standardization.
- vertical space
  - follow my $shelf_box_system , don't buy things you won't be using for the rest of your life, just for the renovation period. So I will use wood to build my ladders and ladder stools.
