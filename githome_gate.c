  - I will try to avoide curves and jig saw, https://youtu.be/u1CJJ0JBzvg?t=19
    - and keep it to table saw and miter saw for less sanding work
    - trim the edges with router https://youtu.be/4XXHj7qqz-o?t=428
  - the screw place needs to be flat for screws and washers
    - the simplest implementation is https://happypeter.github.io/githome/imgs/20220404/1.jpg
    - If I need thiner wood to use shorter bolts https://happypeter.github.io/githome/imgs/20220404/3.jpg
