    - I don't want to do extra work for just design purpose
      - I am not just anti-decration, also anti-design
    - this guideline is here just to avoid me to do wrong and not get me to do more
      - I foucs on functionality and good engineering sense
        - e.g for bright rooms,I add white painted board to walls
          - in order for my tool cleats stand out, I may paint the backboard to white or black
            - sometime when the cleat/hangers and backboard is same color, they are hard to locate
        - e.g I will use dark colored things, but the thinking process is not that I want to banlace the otherwise too milky feelings
          - but rather I want to make things easier to find, say use darker color for tables if your plates are white
            - And it's a problem when it is a problem, don't ever do extra work unless it really improves your functionality
            - everything will be left to its own color by default(wood/concrete), until I have a reason to paint it
        - If there is sth, that is only for esthetic reason, I won't do that

- simplicity is the best design
  - one color for one thing
    - it's OK to have a whole room of white furnitures
    - if I make a white desk, I don't use strong contrast, just keep everything big white, say drawer front and anything
      - for handles, I want a differnt color for funcational purpose, I don't use strong contrast, light gray will do
      - If I use black handle, they must be small enough

- interior general style: white everywhere
  - I use to love concrete wall, turned out they make the room too dark, so abandoned
