    - I don't want to do extra work for just design purpose
      - I am not just anti-decration, also anti-design
    - this guideline is here just to avoid me to do wrong and not get me to do more
      - I foucs on functionality and good engineering sense
        - e.g for bright rooms,I add white painted board to walls
          - in order for my tool cleats stand out, I may paint the backboard to white or black
            - sometime when the cleat/hangers and backboard is same color, they are hard to locate
        - e.g I will use dark colored things, but the thinking process is not that I want to banlace the otherwise too milky feelings
          - but rather I want to make things easier to find, say use darker color for tables if your plates are white
            - And it's a problem when it is a problem, don't ever do extra work unless it really improves your functionality
            - everything will be left to its own color by default(wood/concrete), until I have a reason to paint it
        - If there is sth, that is only for esthetic reason, I won't do that

- concrete color works well with black and white
  - no bottom trim needed https://www.architectureartdesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/16-11-e1489099448128.jpg
  - white wall next to concrete wall https://image.archify.com/blog/03-Contemporary-looking-Exposed-Concrete-Surfaces-s.jpg
- I may need trim when wood meets concrete, they are both rusty and rough

- interior general style: concrete wall + part of wood surface

  - I don't need worry about floor trim

  - since concrete is more water proof(for bathroom and kitch), and budget friendly, so I will use a lot of the concrete surface for the walls
    - the ceiling will be paint to white, concrete works well with white https://design-anthology.com/story/interiors-grey-taipei-ca-design
