NOTE: foucsing on things big and hard that I can not take away, while [soho](soho.md) for the lighter & portable.

## rent_requirments

- my dream home
  - a big open space = living room + dinning room + kitchen
    - its really trendy to have open space https://youtu.be/7BB3YYy8RVw?t=60
    - living room is mainly for projector and crafts
    - share sunshine and maybe more importantly share heating
    - kitchen should have bigger countertop than my current one, enough space for both cutting board and draining rack. No small oily corners. preferably enough space for long hanging rod
  - better to have yards
  - bedroom/office for me and Billie each
    - just a big bedroom, big enough and face south
  - a classroom for Kid
    - this should be in its own room, not in the living room
    - so when Elon is taught, Billie or me is two doors away
  - a laundry room with sunshine to dry clothes
  - toliets have part of the day sunshine(e.g facing east/west) and a natural ventilation(a real window)
  - a open balcony
  - so it's
    dream home = (1 big + 4 medium)sunny rooms + (2toilets +
- can I rent a old apartment? yes, the interior look does not matter, search '出租屋 改造‘ on

  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgcTbLfChV4

- can I rent a poor condition country home(little gated complex)?

  - I am not ready for this.
  - Note all the details in a finished apartment are there for a reason. Not to mention plumbing or heating, even minor things as trims are also cause troble when you try to clean the floor with mop when missing. Sure, you can do that if you want to spend money, but make sure you gurantee a at least 3-year contract with landlord, since it's no small investment.
  - the plumbing is for sure be frozen in winter!!
  - think about how much money to change those poor condition windows to be heating friendly

- requirements

  - network?
  - far enough from noisy traffic?
  - far from noisy dogs?
  - soundproof windows/wall/door
  - proper heating friendly walls/windows?
  - warm bathroom and toilet (consider lady's period)
  - no furniture preferably
  - window size, sunshine
  - DIY tolerant landlord
  - no bugs, espicially those who bite you
  - cooking stove? natural gas?
  - kitchen hood?
  - toliet bowl?
  - windows sealed well? thick walls?
  - noisy? dogs?
  - open space = living room + dinning room + kitchen

- why a poor countryside gated complex?
  - If Musk can build a house on Mars, I can make my accommadation in remote rurals
  - this goal is not to save money, but to understand engineering more deeply, by building things with my own hands.
- design guideline
  - Keyword: standard
    - All the material must be easy and cheap to buy, say I will use concrete to build my sideway, rather than old bricks from old building.
    - Every detail shoud be easily documentable, and every detail is there for a reason, form follows functionality. No fancy tricks for my tempeorary aesthetic taste.
    - the whole design must be very portable to another old country homestead.
    - standardization is a prerequisite for automation
    - think in system, e.g every part of the building should follow the same exterior design and palette.
- the name
  - the gated complex will look techy, demostrate ideas like industrilization and standardization.
- vertical space
  - follow my $shelf_box_system , don't buy things you won't be using for the rest of your life, just for the renovation period. So I will use wood to build my ladders and ladder stools.
- house exterior look
  - white wall + black window/door frame https://youtu.be/qUev14WrTV0?t=86
  - white+black+gray https://youtu.be/p9286KaJjb0?t=35

- shelf diy

  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksPQLovZiII&t=532s
  - https://youtu.be/eNoOsF-bBoc?t=688

- youtube channel 建房子的豆壳儿
- 轻钢 light steel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmxkUiQ2T_c
  - <1mm thickness, it's really suprising
  - even students can build the house by hand https://youtu.be/UGQfAII0hF0?t=55
  - but the structure is super safe, it actully just need far less steel to hold the weight of everythings, but the problem is steel is easy to be twisted,, that's why people need to use more steel for the structure. Anyway, it's super safe for things like earthquick.
  - https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/246386753619278204.html
  - after years of use, the steel is still 100 percent
    recyclable
  - the wall is also super heat keeping, you save 75% money on heating
  - esay to be prefabricated, industrialization friendly
  - only problem: might produce some noise inside rooms

      - 7200~7500rmb/ton 25~30m2/ton, so for a 150m2 house, the steel is just 50000RMB

- Kitchen sewer tank https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1uE411q7GJ
- no sewer solution for toilet https://youtu.be/UGQfAII0hF0?t=267
- https://youtu.be/CoFuQZBPCKo?t=213
  - 'sewer systems at their core are a bunch of sloped piped drains that take your waste from your house to a treatment plant...for the most part...Gravaty does all the work'
  - so the slope is key when I try to build my own toliet/kitchen sewer
  - building a home sewer system is not cheap, to have the slope and keep the pipe from frozen, you need to dig deep https://youtu.be/D1cDwRWekD0?t=133 you need digging machines to do the job https://youtu.be/npVOvrDJGsw?t=35

- you can build the stove in the center https://youtu.be/RzPCB8ES_xc?t=102

  - stove in the wall https://youtu.be/3n3JWNoUALI?t=129

- it make a lot of sense to have a open space, if you want to save on heating
  - get every functionality really close to each other, share light/air/heat. Keeping people together all the time, human bodies are also heating sources.
- air conditioner
  - cons
    - air exchange with outside, make rooms very dry
    - windy & unconfortable
- baseboard heater
  - most comfortable heater of all kinds
