 * - ideas
 *   - mostly follow fixthisbuildthat https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUpTHkthp14
 *   - low shelves are not easy to access, better idea is to have base cabinet with drawers
 *   - more table top spaces. you always need more of it. so my wall+base cabinet set still is the best solution
 *     - for south/north wall spaces, have tool walls between the base and wall cabinets
 *       - the idea is things should be >20cm deep
 *     - for east/west sides, I have 60 deep base cabinets, 
 *       - so that I can install the cabinets low, that I don't need tool walls
 *       - but I will still use stackable boxes to fit in the 50cm or so space between base and wall cabinets, like https://youtu.be/WUpTHkthp14?t=429
 *   - have one or more layer of lumber shelves above wall cabinets
 *   - leave corner area for clamps or stand sth tall against
 *     - like https://youtu.be/kWKqHPhTe6M?t=1
 *   - heavy tool storage, e.g circular saw, jig saw, router...
 *     - box on top of a shallow drawers https://youtu.be/qAWdzCzKT-w?t=662
 *   - small parts storage, e.g screws
 *     - I need to build holders for my small boxes
 *       - a wood version of https://youtu.be/kWKqHPhTe6M?t=221
 *   - off-cuts cart
 *     - 'anything does not fit here, don't keep' https://youtu.be/kWKqHPhTe6M?t=123
