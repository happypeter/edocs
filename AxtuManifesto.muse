*** About this doc 

Software needs its own doc. Linux Kernel uses docbook, my Project Tinylion uses wiki, all nice. But you need to install realted software to write or read these things, so I decide to use html format for this doc, since all computers have browers, so everybody can read it.

Everything shall be kept as easy as possible, I do not use CSS, I will use bluefish to edit my pages, but I will keep the format simple enough to gurantee my own freedom to modify the docs without bluefish
