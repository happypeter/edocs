5. should not lecture this way
I tend to mix things, that is really confusing.
like
http://media.happypeter.org/happycasts/happycity/changchun-casts/ctags.mp4
I try to explain how to cut one file into three, while I am talking about
ctags, that is really bad style.

1. KISS, KISS, KISS !!!

I won't change my happypeter.org structure easily. 

I won't do this just because I see so many beautiful feathers in
Railscasts.com. Simplicity is the best policy.

0. This is a private happyNews here

Look at all my  years of edocs notes-taking, things are scattered here and
there. So for sure it is not wise to mix things up too much, it is also
foolish to separate them to much. 

So these days, I have been using my own happyNews and fail in love with it,
things are mixed, but do not get messy, I think this is simply by having a
name and a NO. for each post.

So this is nice, I will do the same here in edocs. If I have something for vim
or bash in the future, OK, just put them in their own dirs and files. But if I
have something that is hard to categorize. Just post it here, for myself!!!
