### Freedom is good
Just now, when I read _How to become a Hacer_, The part "4. Freedom is good.
Hackers are naturally anti-authoritarian..." made me smiled. Here is  a
story about Microsoft and me. My means to protect my own freedom may seem
stupid to you, but hopefully what I will give here can be informative.

>Anyone who can give you orders can stop you from solving whatever problem you
>are being fascinated by.

That's why I quit my first Asianux job(2009.3~2009.12), and went free hacking
for about 10 months or so. But when the autumn of 2010 was there, I found myself
sitting in the interviewee chair again.

My interviewers were the product manager and dev manager(A guy I respected and
I knew him by his books) from the company named MiniMicrosoft( fake name,
later became my employer). I was in the room first, and I deliberately chose
the chair for the chairman. So why? It was my smoke test to check out if
developers are considered equally as managers here, I did not want to find
another beruecratic crap to work for. 
they were really kind to me, but I kept a big mouth on things( again, I am not
normally that jerky, but a test is a test).It turned out they did not mind at all,
so one week later, I started my job there with 8000RMB/Month and a nice table
beside the dev manager.

There was nothing to complain during the first two weeks, everything was quite
all right, I did some python code on Linux and all. Until the 3rd week, the
boss stepped in.( the investor, a big guy working for Microsoft for more than 10 years,
who was once a developer in MS seatle headquarter, and now some kind of
high-money at Asia Research)

>A hacker may agree to accept some kinds of authority in order to get
>something he wants more than the time he spends following orders. But that's
>a limited, conscious bargain; the kind of personal surrender authoritarians
>want is not on offer.

So the first command he made was that everybody needed to write daily
report(communication is surely important in development within a team, but doing reports
is for me not the way to do it, and it is just a waste of time), even worse,
the report needed to be done with a freaking MS software(again, I did not born
to hate MS, but you know, we were doing Linux development here, and I
personally stopped
using MS Windows years ago...)

>Authoritarians thrive on censorship and secrecy. Any they distrust voluntary
>cooperation and information sharing--they only like 'cooperation' that they
>control.

And obviously the boss saw the reports as a life and death thing, since I liked
the money and the co-workers here, so I decided to accept this and started to do
this.  That was the real flow of the story started:

Boss by Email: "Peter, such a report is not qualified..."

After the whole day of work, I was really tired, "Time should be spent on real
works, not this bullshit" I spoke to myself, but added sth.

Boss again: "Peter, ask guys to see how a report should be done, you are not
allowed to leave until you finish this, cause it is today's work"

Fuck, how comes everybody's is OK, and mine is not. And it was already supper
time.

Me: "I am hungry, I need to go, bye."

I could imagine how the boss looked when he saw this.

>So to behave like a hacker, you have to develop an instinctive hostility to
>censorship, secrecy, and the use of force or deception to compel responsible
>adults. And you have to be willing to act on that belief.
 
Morning of the next day, the meeting room had nobody but the boss(in the
Chairman chair chewing his gum passionate. Fuck, he was there first) and me.

When the talk started, I can clear sense that this was not between peers, but
a clear boss and employee thing, the very feeling just made me sick. But I
actually tried to smile and be easy-going. He was a bit more experienced anyway.

Me: "The report is kind of insult to me, my moral standard is the quality of
my code."

This is something from gun.org I think. And I can see the boss totally did not
know what I was talking about. 

Boss: "The report is the only thing I can get to track people's progress to
make things truly transparent here, you do not report to me, you report to
everybody"

What I know about this is that this is how almost all big companies in Beijing
works, what I do not know is how can this possibly work in software
development. We are not a  Macdonals', where you can easily write down how many
Bergers you sell today, and thus the boss will know how many you need
tomorrow. I know there is heavy management theory backing this kind of
report-based management, but I do not think I can be persuaded by something so
obviously brain-damaged. But anyway, I should be polite and I should stay
hungry and foolish.

Me: "I do not think good software can be done, when the programmers are not
happy, but I am alway ready to change myself"

Boss:" When I joined Microsoft, the dev leader of Ms Office told me something
that happened when he joined MS 25 years ago. He said when he was young and
had lot of ideas for the software being done, but what he got from his boss
was ' Just do the job, do not ask any fucking questions!'. He was not happy at
that time, but 20 years later, he finally understood..."

What a real man he is bearing all the 20 years of pain. All I got from the
story was that Dictatorship really works, if people are all nice and obedient,
the company will work greatly like a mighty machine. I am not a machine, I am
a human. And humans can talk, and when the talk get long enough without going
anywhere, humans got bored.

Boss: "I can give you 3 days, you can choose either writing the report or
leaving."

Me:"Thanks, but I think it will be better if I leave today."

You know what? He hesitated, which I see as a triumph. 

Boss: "Hmmm... I will talk to the dev manager to check your background..."

And he ended the talk just like this. Is that funny? Is that not funny?


That afternoon, he finally found out I was nobody, so he did not offer me a
exception. So I left, leaving this letter

"It smells too much like theory X here, so bye everybody, I offer my apologize."

I tend to mix things, that is really confusing.

I try to explain how to cut one file into three, while I am talking about
ctags, that is really bad style.

I won't change my happypeter.org structure easily. 

I won't do this just because I see so many beautiful feathers in

### This is a private happyNews here
Look at all my  years of edocs notes-taking, things are scattered here and
there. So for sure it is not wise to mix things up too much, it is also
foolish to separate them to much. 

So these days, I have been using my own happyNews and fail in love with it,
things are mixed, but do not get messy, I think this is simply by having a
name and a NO. for each post.

So this is nice, I will do the same here in edocs. If I have something for vim
or bash in the future, OK, just put them in their own dirs and files. But if I
have something that is hard to categorize. Just post it here, for myself!!!
