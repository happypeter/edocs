I will link LGCB within my happycasts, so still happycasts.net will be my
public face.

### nice blog in China
happyNews will eventual become this
http://www.vimer.cn/留言
it should not occupy the main part of frontpage
vimer.cn has nice vim things, I want to post sth there, but my happypeter.org
and happcasts.net are still messy, so I am too shamed to do so.
I need rss like this: http://feed.feedsky.com/vimer

I shall be friends with them:

### happycasts
When I was making a happycasts on github basic usage, I am tempted to make it
a showoff talk, showing people the wiki, graph, fork... and everything. no,
don't do this. happycasts is "getting the job done", not "strip-tease"

trying to cover all the feathers is kind of the "draw whole strucure" task, so
more suitable for LGCB. But even LGCB is not about "strip-teasing". It is
about making people understand.

maybe I will build another site: Linux-strip-teasing.com :) joking.

### Happycasts VS Lgcb
Both are "show don't tell", serve the beginners. teach Linux basics, platforms
change fast, but look at TLCL, most stuff has not changed for half a century,
yet it is still so useful for anybody.

L: understanding basics -> people from zero
H: getting the job done -> people has a bit background knoeledge

L: all slides(charts, diagrams, tables ..)
H: only screen

L: for absolute beginners, but it is not about something that people can
easily find out by books, if so, why bother to make a cast. So "fix
difficulies" for beginners. Like students can easily find out what "ls" or
"cd .." means in books, so no need to cover all the details in LGCB(give it in
"further reading"), instead try to help students understand the whole picture
of filesystem tree.
H: even it requires some background understanding of the basics, I will still
make all happycasts for BEGINERS. Just think about how railscasts helped me
when I am a by-all-means beginner.

### I am deleting my blog.chinaunix.net
I see tag like "last change in 10_17_2008" on many posts, Thx God, now I have
git.

All the posts are in English, this is the place where I start my
all-in-english plan. 

    My Plan--v0.1
    (2007-12-14 19:43:34)

    My plan

    From now on I will try to do things listed below;

    1. All my reading material shall be in English only

    2. I will take notes in English too

    3. I know it is almost impossiable to do so, but “almost” is not “definately”,
       I will have a  try even though I face the difficulties of today and
       tomorrow.

    4. Life is but a mountain of despair if....

Many posts are on hardware, bad, bad, bad.

I posted some ESR articles on it, I posted my code, my debug log, I still
backup all these with buring CD. How stupid I was. 

I did Qt, qtopia, protel, usb, ethernet, I read cpu UM, I learn bash, c, c++
all together, all kinds of shit, why I was so mad,
it was all because I wanted get that fucking degree.



SO sorry for keeping my pullution for so long, guys. Now everything is gone.

EDIT: not quite. I still have shit at
http://happypeter.ycool.com/(ID:happypeter, PW:111111), now deleted
link their.


### happycasts

Guide line:

 1. Linux centered, if I want do casts on rails, put it elsewhere
 2. "get the job done" centered, fix one problem, do one task in each episode, 
    if I want to explain logics, do it elsewhere
 3. so no slides here
 4. vim, git, bash, apache, and how to setup php, how to config ROR on Linux, how to
    use vim to develop ROR, how to use github... are on topic
 5. how to implement qq-auth in Ruby, how to write html, are currently off
    topic, but I may add these into happycasts in the future
 6. Good branding = one style(get the job done) + one scope(Linux tips for
    developers)
### known to the world
I did a google search for "happypeter.org", no one link to me, fuck! I will
try to change this by providing sth really nice for the world.

### DHH basecamp to rails
PHP does not have layers(MVC), it does everything in one scripting Lanague
### Jack Dorsey-- co-founder  twitter 
make every detail perfect, and limit the number of details

expect the unexpected, whenever possiable be the unexpected.

What the story is, how can the people join, when I show my friend this, how
will they react.

apple runs like a theater company, they have great sense of pacing, great
sense of story. It is all event driven, it all stage driven.


### happycasts
Railscasts: no slides, "get the job done", intermediate developer
Railsforzombies: only slides, try to make the basics clear, for absolute
beginners.

I hope my happycasts be railscasts, never try to explain too much, just show people
how to do it.

Railsforzombies also nice, but it is something dfferent, I won't mix is into
my happycasts. It is nice to have this kind of videos for my LGCB.

Good branding is very improtant. When asked what I am doing here at
happypeter.org, I have no short answer. Happynews is just a forum, it is not a
product. So now I need a product, something can be described in one short
sentence.

I want a railscast.com for Linux. So the product is "Linux Screencasts for
Chinese Beginners"(LSCB). 

- I will make it beautiful 
- I will not mix things up( If I want to talk about rails, I can open another
  site for it). 
- this will be at least one release every monday(like railscasts)

### ideas for EC (english corner)
We shall have prepared speeches, and the topics shall be choosed by the
speakers themselves, althogh we can give our suggestions. You will need to:

 1. write down what you are going to talk, at least some main points.
 2. it  must be something useful or beautiful, or make good fun, we do not
    want copied work(sure, you can steal stories somewhere, but you still need
    to give your ideas about these stroies, anyway, we need to make friends
    with you, so plz show yourself, and be yourself)
 3. we do not want non-sense, we do not want waste our time by listening to
    something we don't give a damn to. Let's add real value to our EC.

### 新文学青年

我这里所谓的文学青年指的是大学时代读书多，有思想，毕业以后想贡献社会，不想让自己的才华在平庸中凋零的人。

先说说＂旧＂文学青年的苦恼。以两类人为例，第一类是文字作者，例如诗人，另一类是美学工作者，例如画家。诗人很苦恼，因为诗稿发不出去，大家都在上网，享受网上的文学快餐。画家也不快乐，因为他们找不着工作，几百年来他们的一份很赚钱的工作：给有钱人画像。现在已经被数码相机所取代。总之，对他们而言，理想和吃饭问题的矛盾很尖锐。

再聊聊，高科技，互联网的今天，我们如何＂新＂起来。文学青年一定会很穷吗？我们来举一个反例，苹果公司的乔布斯。我并不赞同他的所有观点，我只是觉得他符合我的新文学青年的定义，他喜欢文字，喜欢审美，他的成功来自于他把这些东西用高科技的手段来表达，这是＂新＂。

程序员是新文学青年的一种，程序员最基本的素质是用机器语言和人类语言来表达自己的思想，目前全球最成功的一批程序员其实本质上都是一些作家，和社会活动家。再就是随着苹果公司的兴起，程序设计界对于美工设计也渐渐给予了应有的重视。

如果你认为高级程序员＝数学家+电子工程师，我可以说你是对的，但是在几十年前。新的定义是程序员=
诗人+画家。旧时代的技术条件，决定了程序员需要对机器付出足够的感情，才会得到它的青睐，随着技术的发展，很多强大的技术都渐趋成熟，程序设计也自然重在人性的方面了。

象我本人是作互联网应用的。要做出好的用户体验，不仅需要扎实的技术，更需要的是taste（just
like Steve Jobs stressed all these years)


### How to organize a talk?

Do not try to stress too many points, but try to give 3 points, not too many,
even when you are trying to tell other people about your whole life, like
steve jobs.

Like if I need to tell the students about my last 10 years life. I can
organize everything around 3 lessons I learned during the years.
1. If u love English, make sure ur major will take u a job in which English
   does matter

2. Whatever u do, first thing to concern is which kind of people u want to
   work with.

3. Not just find a day job, find out ur true love, and make it a career
   for ur whole life. Like I like hacking, but hated my day job, all I
   really love is actually creating things for the people I love, that't
   whyni am here in SJZ.

### 文质彬彬学英语
我们先从我们如何轻松的学会我们的母语，同时又是如何痛苦并且恶心的学不会英语这两个事实做一个对比，来讨论一下目前的大学英语教育有哪些问题。

“文质彬彬”
这个词中国人日常生活中都在用，但是我们有没有必要一定要知道“文”“质”到底是指什么，当然不用。我想我是这样学会这个词的，首先爸爸指着一个长的很帅的戴眼镜的人，说这个人“文质彬彬”，
然后我就记住了，文质彬彬=帅+眼镜。过了几天，爸爸又指着一个长的不帅的同时也戴眼镜的人说他也文质彬彬，那我就推断文质彬彬中应该把帅去掉...总而言之，我们的认识是在实践中，自然演进的，这个过程并不太科学，我们会走很多弯路，但是没有痛苦，毫不费力的我们就熟练运用了这个词。

然后我们假想一下用我们课堂学英语的方法，来教别人使用这个词。那我们就会先解释各部分含义，然后分析组成逻辑语法结构。然后拿出古语中给出的这个成语的严格定义...这个过程是严格的，学术的。但是学习过程是非人性的，痛苦的，最要命的是其实在日常生活中，我们使用的词很多都已经发生了转意，即使你把文质彬彬的定义记住了，你也不会用。同时这个定义你记得越牢固，用这个词的时候就会越让普通人听不懂。这也就是我们普通大学生的学英语现状，感觉内容又多又难（语言是人的基本能力，傻子都会说话，如果你觉得学英语很难，那基本可以说你的学习方法是错误的，当然这主要要归咎于学校的应试教育）。

所以，忘记语法学习，忘记考试，像我们学母语一样学习。

现在我来说说文质彬彬的典故。论语中说“文胜质则野，质胜文则史，文质彬彬，然后君子。”我这里稍微曲解一下，来阐述一下英语学习的正确方法。“文”是指的细节的东西，例如单词量，基础知识，这些东西不宜多学。那何为“多”？就是你的单词量，大大超越了你的实际英文运用水平，就是你的“质”，这时，学英语的时候你就会感觉痛苦，说或是写出来的英语就会让别人痛苦。

Tagline

Essays are the start.

Ycombinator grew out of the talk how to do a startup, pg gave at harward.

Everybody takes summer job a throw away thing, so if we screw up, no one will
blame us.

Weekly dinner

What works for startups?

    1. launching fast
    2. Be highly engaged with ur customers.


Why the name ycombinator?

It is a programming trick, We want the hackers to notice us, while keep people
we do not like afar.

Designing a good UI is just writing a essay, u just need to figure out the
essential things.

Hacker news?
Try arc, not having enough patience for a sub reddit for startups, the two
reasons lead to hn.

HackerNews was initially named StartupNews, with a bunch of founders as its
readers.

Not having a co-founder will kill you, try to find one.

HongFeng think it might be better for me to follow Paul Gramham, first build a
startup, and teach people how to build a startup. However my focus is educate
stduents to be a good learner, building a startup is surely the NEXT-step
thing, which I am neither good at nor passionate about.

Great joy to meet a Fine Art and a KongFu teacher(yiquan168.com) on my way back, I am so much
surprised to so how open-minded they are, they are very good teachers.

### slogan for happypeter.org

A lot people has been asking that what is happypeter.org for. To answer this,
I think it is now about the time to choose a slogan for it, and I have these
in mind now:

1. Learn Programming With English 用英语学编程 This is a specific one. And
this is truly what I am willing to do. Being a programmer means you won't go
hungery in this world. Learn it with English textbooks, screencasts, and open
lectures is the only right way to do it.

Happypeter.org Products: vocabulary books, screencasts, forums(where you can learn to describe tech problems in English, as a stepstone before you join real enlgish-speaking communities)...well organized basic learning meritals(links and tranlations).

BUT, if the site is for learning with English, why you provide for many screencasts in Chinese. So maybe "Learn by doing" is really what I want. So maybe I justuse learn by doing, as use English, programming, Dream, money as tags.

2. Make dream making money 理想和吃饭 A bit romatic powder on this one. What
happypeter.org is providing is not just some training that helps while you are
hunting for a job. It is serious eduction here, helping you with writing,
coding, learning.So it is not about a code monkey job that makes the bread, it
is about a career that fills our life a meaning.

### Freedom is good
Just now, when I read _How to become a Hacer_, The part "4. Freedom is good.
Hackers are naturally anti-authoritarian..." made me smile. Here is  a
story about Microsoft and me. My means to protect my own freedom may seem
stupid, but hopefully what I give here can be informative.

>Anyone who can give you orders can stop you from solving whatever problem you
>are being fascinated by.

That's why I quit my first Asianux job(2009.3~2009.12), and went free hacking
for about 10 months or so. But when the autumn of 2010 was there, I found myself
sitting in the interviewee chair again.

My interviewers were the product manager and dev manager(A guy I respected and
I knew him by his books) from the company named MiniMicrosoft( fake name,
stream media service provider powered by Linux). I was in the room first, and I deliberately chose
the chair for the chairman. So why? It was my smoke test to check out if
developers are considered equally as managers here, I did not want to find
another beruecratic crap to work for. 
It turned out that they were kind to me, while I kept a big mouth on things( again, I am not
normally that jerky, but a test is a test). 
So one week later, I started my work there with 8000RMB/Month and a nice table
beside the dev manager.

There was nothing to complain during the first two weeks, everything was quite
all right, I did some python code on Linux and all. Until the 3rd week, the
boss stepped in.( the investor, a big guy working for Microsoft for more than 10 years,
who was once a developer in MS seatle headquarter, and now some kind of
high-money at Asia Research)

>A hacker may agree to accept some kinds of authority in order to get
>something he wants more than the time he spends following orders. But that's
>a limited, conscious bargain; the kind of personal surrender authoritarians
>want is not on offer.

So the first command he made was that everybody needed to write daily
report(communication is surely important in development within a team, but doing reports
is for me not the way to do it, and it is just a waste of time), even worse,
the report needed to be done with a freaking MS software(again, I did not born
to hate MS, but you know, we were doing Linux development here, and I
personally stopped
using MS Windows years ago...)

>Authoritarians thrive on censorship and secrecy. Any they distrust voluntary
>cooperation and information sharing--they only like 'cooperation' that they
>control.

And obviously the boss saw the reports as a life and death thing, since I liked
the money and the co-workers here, so I decided to accept this and started to do
this.  That was the real flow of the story started:

Boss by Email: "Peter, such a report is not qualified..."

After the whole day of work, I was really tired, "Time should be spent on real
works, not this bullshit" I spoke to myself, but finally added sth.

Boss again: "Peter, ask guys to see how a report should be done, you are not
allowed to leave until you finish this, cause it is today's work"

Fuck, how comes everybody's is OK, and mine is not. And it was already supper
time.

Me: "I am hungry, I need to go, bye."

I could imagine how the boss looked when he saw this.

>So to behave like a hacker, you have to develop an instinctive hostility to
>censorship, secrecy, and the use of force or deception to compel responsible
>adults. And you have to be willing to act on that belief.
 
Next morning, the meeting room had nobody but the boss(in the
Chairman chair chewing his gum passionately. Fuck, he was there first) and me.

When the talk started, I can clearly  feel that this was not between peers, but
a clear boss and employee thing, the very feeling just made me sick. But I
actually tried to smile and be easy-going. He was a bit more experienced anyway, maybe I can learn sth from him.

Me: "The report is kind of insult to me, my moral standard is the quality of
my code."

This is something from gun.org I think. And I can see the boss totally did not
know what I was talking about. 

Boss: "The report is the only thing I can get to track people's progress.
Things are made truly transparent here, you do not report to me, you report to
everybody."

What I know about this is that this is how almost all big companies in Beijing
are running, what I do not know is how can this possibly work in software
development. We are not a  Macdonals', where you can easily write down how many
Bargers you sell today, and thus the boss will know how many you need
tomorrow. I know there is heavy management theory backing this kind of
report-based management, but I do not think I can be persuaded by something so
obviously brain-damaged. But anyway, I should be polite and I should stay
hungry and foolish.

Me: "I do not think good software can be done, when the programmers are not
happy, but I am alway ready to change myself"

Boss: " I want zero cost on management"

Me:" Sure, the reports make your job a lot easier, and lower the management
consumption, on your side. Have you ever think about, how much time the
developers spend for the reports..."

I did not made my point clear though, it was not only the 5 mins you wasted, it is
about the reports actually forced you to do dev in a total different manner.
More "deliverable" means less
time for thinking about the best solution for a problem, people start to focus on how
many lines of code you produce each day, not the quality of it.
More control on everybody helps to keep everybody busy, sure nobody is lazy means
less cost for the company on Human Resource. But this is sheer folly too. If
more freedom is given to the developer, and make the developer love their
work, they will(mostly likely) behave like a "responsible adults", and
try to do good code, how much time can be saved on refactoring and debugging in
the later phase of development. For me, if I am happy with the job, I will
prefer to work long hours and take less money, I think this is but human
nature, if you make the job boring, people get tired and not learning
anything, their "cost" to work here is huge, so they will either want a lot
more money or just leave.

You can not put more water into a full cup. You can tell, but they won't
listen.

Boss:" When I joined Microsoft, the dev leader of Ms Office told me something
that happened when he joined MS 25 years ago. He 
had lot of ideas for the software being done, but what he got from his boss
was this: 'Just do the job, do not ask any fucking questions!'. He was not happy at
that time, but 20 years later, he finally understood..."

What a real man he was bearing all the 20 years of pain. All I got from the
story was that Dictatorship really works, if people are all nice and obedient,
the company will work greatly like a mighty machine. I am not a machine, I am
a human. And humans can talk, and when the talk get long enough without going
anywhere, humans got bored.

Boss: "I can give you 3 days, you can choose either writing the report or
leaving."

Me:"Thanks, but I think it will be better if I leave today."

You know what? He hesitated, which I see as a triumph. 

Boss: "Hmmm... I will talk to the dev manager to check your background..."

And he ended the talk just like this. Is that funny? Is that not funny?


That afternoon, he finally found out I was nobody, so he did not offer me a
exception. So I left, leaving this letter

"It smells too much like theory X here, so bye everybody, I offer my apologize."

I won't do this just because I see so many beautiful feathers in

### This is a private happyNews here
Look at all my  years of edocs notes-taking, things are scattered here and
there. So for sure it is not wise to mix things up too much, it is also
foolish to separate them to much. 

So these days, I have been using my own happyNews and fail in love with it,
things are mixed, but do not get messy, I think this is simply by having a
name and a NO. for each post.

So this is nice, I will do the same here in edocs. If I have something for vim
or bash in the future, OK, just put them in their own dirs and files. But if I
have something that is hard to categorize. Just post it here, for myself!!!
