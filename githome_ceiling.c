    - wood is wet without ventilation
      - even you seal the ceiling well, moisture can still goes in the attic through walls
    - will do two things
      - open vents at east and weat walls
        - connect the rooms by having holes along the beam direction
        - it's easy
        - indoor ventilation does not work
          - all hot air go to attic space, that's cause condensation and heat loss
        - luckily even for rooms with beam exposed, the space above the rocksheet still connects
      - keep observation door for the ceiling
        - if wood rafters are dry in winter, consider seal the vents to make the room warmer
- How to vent attic space?
  - my father's house use shingle vent plus gable vent, that's a lot of
    venting, that's why the attic area is always same temperature as outer
    space, as it should. - https://youtu.be/ckXfYty_Cqg?t=90 'you attic air is supposed to be the
    same temperature as the outdoor air', of course, if you intentionally
    have small vents, you can get a warmer attic, then you are doing it wrong, end
    up with ice dams and ruin your house.
  - https://youtu.be/vShj1l0PnF0?t=59 Both high and low vents are needed to get
    good circulation.
  - how big should the vents be?
    - 1 to 150 rule https://youtu.be/vShj1l0PnF0?t=238
    - use 1 to 300 rule if you have enough high vents
