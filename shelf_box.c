- basic shelf structure https://youtu.be/edh0SjQReDw?t=7
- mobile shelves with casters, can work well with my wall hung ones
  - for clamps https://youtu.be/meEYwk6Olik?t=37
  - for wood scraps , see mobile_wood_storage.c
- use 28x68 treated wood as cleat
  - NOTE: next version I can going to use glued ply wood, as show here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfuwKXPRKu8
    - treat wood is way too soft for the job
  - arm length 450, short end edge length 30, large end 120
    - plywood cut
    - lumber cut 
  - holding span
    - 1500, so it is OK for 2m lumbers
    - arm number: 3
  - cleat length, upright support
    - 50+120+220+120 = 560 //50 for extra support strength
    - vertical space needed
      - 220+120+220+120 = 680 

- wall hung shelf to hold lumber
  - adjustable one https://youtu.be/GXHyias2C6w?t=320

    - lesson learned from the failure of version One
      - don't use nails close to the edge of the wood, split!
      - don't let grain direction to carry main load, split!
    - what can be improved for version Two
      - the small triangle can be just a strip with 45degree ends
      - the part of the wall-hung board above the big triangle should be longer, to avoid split.
      - thicker wall-hung board, so that I can use screws to fasten the plywood triangle to the board. when the shelf carry load, the download force will be turned into horizontal force away from the wall, and the 90degree angle of the big triangle area(both the triangle and wall-hung board)will be under great pressure. As tested, when I hanged my body, the nails in the wall hung board tried to go away from the wall, but they need to shear the wood fibers, before they fail. So even though the  the board are very thin and soft, it did not break. But If in the next verion I use screw(thicker than nails) and thicker board, it will be much harder to shear the board, the shelf will be much more sturdy.
      - the lower part of the big triangle does don't carry a lot of burden, so should be shorter.

- requirements
  - stackable
    - full use of shelf vertical space
    - drawers ring a bell
    - make things perfect cuboid
    - sizes, anything times 10cm
    - care for being stackable, not nesting
      - only care exterior sizes, go free for wall thickness
      - two sons does not need to fit into a father
  - free style
    - a box could be a drawers, a crate, or anthing
- lumber shelf
  - MY DESIGN
    - use my 83x8x8 lumber and 25mm steel pipe
      - use 3 pipes on each lumber, each at 13cm, 43cm, 73cm from the top
      - each lumber is 50cm away from the next, so the shelf would be 2m long
      - 2m long 3 layer shelf
  - wood+steelPipe https://youtu.be/pIJG7Zp8iN4?t=582
    - 3inch deep into the wood
  - lumber storage should be far from your bench
  - small offcuts storage shelf
    - best: a crate
      - how to build a crate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaN8cFByOeg
      - future https://youtu.be/kWKqHPhTe6M?t=126

   
- big things go to crates
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaN8cFByOeg
  - e.g when I want to put away my nailers, I can use a crate, and nest small boxes in it for nails and other small parts. 
- small things build with 18cm plywood(as frame) plus mdf or thin 8cm plywood (as walls)
- first project should be a box for my grinder accessories


- lumbers go high
  - https://youtu.be/kWKqHPhTe6M?t=155
- small drawers for small parts that does not go to my cleat system

  - figure out the cutlist before hand

    - for each size, you only need one time measuring to set stopper postion
      - the inital measuring does not have to be super precise
      - because, repeated cuts will give all the pieces same size
  - plywood will be used to make the whole structure strong
    - only two size where handles are use ply
    - for smaller box, I could use 9mm, or turn to OSB for cheaper materials
    - make sure bottom of the box is within the height of plywood sides
  - cut grooves/rails
    - set table saw fence
    - set table saw blade height 1.2
      - panel will be embedded 1cm into the rails
      - panel is not glued to the frame but is left to 'float' within it so that seasonal movement of the wood comprising the panel does not distort the frame.

  - this shelf design https://happypeter.github.io/githome/imgs/20220304/
    - it is ajustable, I can change the height of each tier easily
    - I can add casts to it, or hang it on the wall use franch cleats
  - but treated wood and ceiling strips are too soft for shelves
    - even I added some triangle enhancement, it is still loose and shaky
    - would love to turn to a full plywood version structure
