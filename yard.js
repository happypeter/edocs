  /* I want to build a patio to cover the pit 
   part of the pit will be covered by unmovable slab
   - make the lid on high end of the patio pitch, so that not much water will flow into the pit through the edge gaps
     - and make the edge of the opening a bit high
     - I saw a  electric checkpoint was just less than 1cm higher than the ground, with a metal lid 
   leaving a small enough pid lid, that I can lift up when needed
   build the lid with concrete, install a handle to life up
   - make the bottom of pit covered with gravels, so that rain water can sink in
     - if underground water come out? I need a build a water proof concrete pit for the pressure tank
