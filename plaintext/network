## beijing router
there is a port named *WAN*
you nust plug the *input* cable into this port.
and there is also a led for this, if it is off, that means you wan input is down
then my laptop shows me the connection is active, but this only means it connected well with the router, since the *wan* is not connected well to the router, so there is no way to visit www with my laptop now

in ubuntu 10.04:

basiclly all I did was to follow the instruction of the `pppoeconf` command

all it takes are the *userID* and *PassWord*
other things are all defauted.

$pon dsl-provider

if things are not valid, try above command to restart the service.

I know *pppoe* is in use by checking the configrations in Windows.
