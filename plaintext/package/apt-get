People say aptitude has better dependency tracking than apt-get, can not believe it!!
## download deb

	sudo apt-get source network-manager --compile

try to download deb with this, but failed for build dependency check. intalled `dpkg-dev`
but not all deps are satisfied. 

but I can find url in /etc/apt/sources.list, and get it by

    firefox http://cn.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/x/xorg/

    
## uninstall packages

    apt-get purge vim-core
 
## get exact package name
    
    pet@cow:~$ dpkg-query -l|grep emacs
    
    pet@cow:~$ dpkg-query -L emacs-goodies-el|grep colo
    /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/emacs-goodies-el/color-theme.el
    pet@cow:~$ 
    

## dep error

some times:

    failed deps: bar1.1 is reuiquied by bar1.2 is to be installed

this is simplely because you are now have a higher version than what is depended on.
the fix:
    
    aptitude purge bar

then things shall work.

#### my gem install rmagick horror

so first I see this error:

    checking for Magick-config... no

obviously I need the header-files, the what google tells me:

   sudo apt-get install libmagick9-dev

so I did, then I found this really require me to do a lot of `purge bar`, casue it rely on many old packages,
but this lead to crazy situation like

    After this operation, 1,485 MB disk space will be freed.
    You are about to do something potentially harmful.
    To continue type in the phrase 'Yes, do as I say!'
     ?] 

then what to do?

so I download the .deb file from 
http://packages.ubuntu.com/natty/i386/libmagickwand-dev/download

    dpkg -x somepackage.deb ./temp

and then build myself another deb file with all the files I get and no dependences.
