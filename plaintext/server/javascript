# jquery error

say you have this

    //=require jquery
    //=require jplayer
    //=require bootstrap

then you find out if you put jplayer after bootstrap, then jplayer stops working. now you know its because
this is a error in bootstrap.js

then anything after bootstrap won't work, you can not use `$(document).ready()` in a view file, but you can still call js function there.

now I see why I have to put my scripts at the bottom of the page, cause load sequence matters
but I can fix this with

    doucument.ready()
