## doc ubuntu

ubuntu has nice docs on server admin:

## hosting provider

## ssh 

http://progit.org/book/ch4-1.html

install openssh-server

the server side must be a bare repo

    git clone peter@happypeter.org:repo.git

be sure to have `repo.git` in /home/peter/ rather than /var/www

anyway http is port80 while ssh is 22

add public key to happypeter.org is easy:

    ssh-copy-id peter@happypeter.org

check this for more <https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/openssh-server.html>

## jekyll


add  some code in `.git/hook/post-receive`

so that jekyll will do a updated on the site


    echo "hi jekyll"
    echo $PWD
    cd ..
    git clone happypeter.github.com.git
    cd happypeter.github.com
    rm -rf /var/www/site
    jekyll && mv _site /var/www/site # chown peter /var/www
    cd ..
    rm -rf  happypeter.github.com

# install server 10.10

you need to install the os with your eth net cable plugged in, otherwise when you reboot the os, you see no 'eth0' in the output of `ifconfig`

## now config ip

have this in /etc/network/interfaces:


    #loopback network interface
    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback

    # The primary network interface
    auto eth0
    #iface eth0 inet dhcp (peter commented out this line)
    iface eth0 inet static

    address 192.168.1.108
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    # use `route` to get gateway as 'defaut' in the output
    gateway 192.168.1.1
    broadcast 192.168.1.255

ping www.baidu.com worked after os reboot(if u use `sudo
/etc/init.d/networking restart` here, u end up with a error, so just do a os reboot), eventhough I did not config DNS.

## DNS

nice post:
http://www.ubuntugeek.com/ubuntu-networking-configuration-using-command-line.html


    $ cat /etc/resolv.conf 
    nameserver 211.161.46.85
    nameserver 211.161.46.84

## now connected without my router

this time dhcp failed,(since my home net use pppoe), but nice thing is if pompmted for a ip address(which is the case I should use in Qishang server room). But now I gave only a junk address and everything, but even though eth0 was there when the install was finished and I just copied what I should give to /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/resolv.conf

reboot, and ping baidu.com worked

## now without cable at all

you will still have eth0 as long as you do not choose `Do not config network this time`, that's my lastest two installations showed.
