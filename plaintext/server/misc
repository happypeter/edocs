Actual Steps:

1. check the bios, found out the first boot device is network, this is bullshit

2. so I change it to hard disk
ERROR: boot up stop at:

~~~bash 
(initramfs)
~~~

3. I asked for a USB CD drive
ERROR: bios could not find this device

4. got another CD drive, and change `first boot device` to it
ERROR: failed to read my 11.04 Desktop into RAM, io error

5. reboot and try it again, 11.04 showed up, and I need to connect the mouse to click and check if the harddisk can be mounted.
RESULT: I could open all my partitions, nothing strange, everything is a OK.

6. try to get my network config back, I need to write the content in `/etc/networking/interfaces/` and `/etc/resov.conf` down on to a piece of paper, for later use if I need the reinstall 10.10 server.
RESULT: it turned up this step was not useful, since I did not need to reinstall the system.

7. now try to boot from 10.10 server CD.
However I did not select `install ubuntu`, rather, I tried `boot from harddisk`.
ERROR: this showed up

~~~bash
Errors were found while checking the disk drive for /
Press F to attempt to fix the errors, I to ignore, S to skip moounting, or M for manual recorvery.
~~~

8. I typed `F` to try my luck. The after a series of `OK`s and `wrong`s.
reboot, lover is back.

9. That is all.

## forced reboot

so my whole system went readonly days ago, no one can figure out what is happening, The fix was a forced reboot:

    echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
    echo b > /proc/sysrq-trigger

    Secret Question:
        what's the name of your first pet?
        tomboy

1. to setup DNS, I just update the nameSever used by domain.com with linode
   nameservers:
     1. http://www.domain.com/controlpanel/domaincentral/ change
"Nameservers"(not "DNS"), then
set ns1.linode.com, ns2....

   and did all the DNS setting at linode.com
   1. to add a sub domain, like peter.happyec.org, go to linode.com->DNS manager->"point peter.h.org to any IP" ->wait for 15 mins

# linode

after upgrade my plan form 19$/mo to 29$/mo, I did not go to https://manager.linode.com/linodes/resize/linode171551
and resize my machine, so I was charged for the 29$ plan, but still using the 19$ machine, for many months.

## jekyll


add  some code in `.git/hook/post-receive`

so that jekyll will do a updated on the site


    echo "hi jekyll"
    echo $PWD
    cd ..
    git clone happypeter.github.com.git
    cd happypeter.github.com
    rm -rf /var/www/site
    jekyll && mv _site /var/www/site # chown peter /var/www
    cd ..
    rm -rf  happypeter.github.com

# install server 10.10

you NEED to install the os with your eth net cable plugged in, otherwise when you reboot the os, you see no 'eth0' in the output of `ifconfig`

## now config ip

have this in /etc/network/interfaces:


    #loopback network interface
    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback

    # The primary network interface
    auto eth0
    #iface eth0 inet dhcp (peter commented out this line)
    iface eth0 inet static

    address 192.168.1.108
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    # use `route` to get gateway as 'defaut' in the output
    gateway 192.168.1.1
    broadcast 192.168.1.255

ping www.baidu.com worked after os reboot(if u use `sudo
/etc/init.d/networking restart` here, u end up with a error, so just do a os reboot), eventhough I did not config DNS.

## DNS

nice post:
http://www.ubuntugeek.com/ubuntu-networking-configuration-using-command-line.html


    $ cat /etc/resolv.conf 
    nameserver 211.161.46.85
    nameserver 211.161.46.84

## now connected without my router

this time dhcp failed,(since my home net use pppoe), but nice thing is if pompmted for a ip address(which is the case I should use in Qishang server room). But now I gave only a junk address and everything, but even though eth0 was there when the install was finished and I just copied what I should give to /etc/network/interfaces and /etc/resolv.conf

reboot, and ping baidu.com worked

## now without cable at all

you will still have eth0 as long as you do not choose `Do not config network this time`, that's my lastest two installations showed.

## install on server

There are three plugs on the box, note the LEFTMOST(leftmost) one is eth0. Wong plug won't work.


## Lover condigs(when it is up and running)

/etc/network/interfaces

    # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
    # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

    # The loopback network interface
    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback

    # The primary network interface
    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
        address 122.115.61.189
        netmask 255.255.255.192
        network 122.115.61.128
        broadcast 122.115.61.191
        gateway 122.115.61.129
        # dns-* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed
        dns-nameservers 202.106.0.20
        #petercommented dns-search happypeter.org

/etc/resov.conf

    nameserver 219.141.136.10
    nameserver 219.141.140.10


## tips
Plug mouse and keyboard in, before you try to boot from CD. otherwise you may endup with a 
ERROR: input output error

to reboot the lover box, hold down Power button for 5 seconds, when the box is down press Power button again.
The reboot button simply won't work, when os is not installed well.
