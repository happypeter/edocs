    Secret Question:
        what's the name of your first pet?
        tomboy

1. to setup DNS, I just update the nameSever used by domain.com with linode
   nameservers:
     1. http://www.domain.com/controlpanel/domaincentral/ change
"Nameservers"(not "DNS"), then
set ns1.linode.com, ns2.... it may take 24hours for changes to take effect

   and did all the DNS setting at linode.com
   1. to add a sub domain, like peter.happyec.org, go to linode.com->DNS manager->"point peter.h.org to any IP" ->wait for 15 mins
