# put things into production

## db
first error: no db: happycasts_developement
fix: 

    RAILS_ENV=production rake db:create
    mysql -uroot happycasts_production<happycasts_development.sql

## rake assets:precompile

now I did a rails update to 3.2.6

the error:

    Sass::SyntaxError in Episodes#index

    Showing /home/peter/sites/happycasts/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb where line #6 raised:

    Invalid CSS after "...me-webfont.eot": expected ")", was "?#iefix) format..."
      (in /home/peter/sites/happycasts/app/assets/stylesheets/application.css.scss)"


this is becasue I have "bootstrap_and_overrides.css.less"
remove this line in `application.css.scss`

now `rake assets:precompile` done

go on following railscasts#pipelineInProduction

## get rid of less

### funny thing about bundler
so I delete a Gem in .rvm/, but when I try to go back to do `bundle install ` `bundle update` stuff
bundler will always think the gem is still their, and just does nothing, for anything to work
`gem uninstall the_gem` first

now in `application.css`
I have to put `@import "bootstrap"` below `@import "peter"`, otherwise it does not work, why?

now to bundle install nokogiri
I need `sudo apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1.1 libxslt1-dev` on ubuntu 1204

run

    RAILS_ENV=production rake db:create
    RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate
    RAILS_ENV=production rake assets:precompile
