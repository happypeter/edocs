# how to start coding, by Chris and Kevin

1. first you have a user story
1. this is called BDD, or outside in development
1. then you split in to several tasks
1. pick one task and then you start to think what kind of data I need
1. that is you start to a model first, say post.body post.name
1. now I need to think how I expose these data, or maybe also logic in the model to the user
1. so I go to route.rb
1. no controller -> no action -> no template -> create view...
1. yea, that's it!
# gem server

##DNS
nice doc: http://library.linode.com/dns-guides/introduction-to-dns

goto:
https://secure.domain.com/account/am/mydomains.php
click "happycasts.net" -> name servers -> click "update name server" -> now

http://library.linode.com/dns-guides/configuring-dns-with-the-linode-manager

add 

    ns1.linode.com
    ns2.linode.com
    ns3.linode.com
 
as the name server used by domain.com, so now when I visit "happycasts.net" it will go to domain.com, then domain.com will use the linode.com name server, thus all the records about DNS records are done on linode.com

add media.happycasts.net as a new A record, then I go for it in firefox at once, when firefox showed me a "address not found" page, I need to wait for some time obvious. but even a quarter hour passed, and the media.happycasts.net already works in safari, firefox still gives me the "not found" page.


now I have problem using "happyec.org" in IE, while I have no issue using "happycasts.net", so I go to linode, and add a empty AAAA record and try again, waiting .............???????????? while linode will update its own DNS server in 15 mins, but IE still can not access "happyec.org", it seems it will wait for 2 days until the "empty-hostname.happyec.org"(AKA, happyec.org) will be updated by main DNS servers. NO, it works, just three hours later, huriii!

### use passenger in a higher verion of ruby

 first install passenger in rvm-ruby=1.9.3(the new version), now paste the tree lines into /etc/apache2/http.conf( yes, replace the lines for 1.9.2, there is no way to use passenger for more than one version of ruby)

now I still need to run "rvm 1.9.3 --default", otherwise my websites will still try to use 2.9.2, and no one can go alive.

when I done with happyec.org, which is using 1.9.3 ruby, all my other sites using 1.9.2 will be started with this error: (Bundler::GemNotFound). I know the fix is simple go to the root of each project and run "bundle install" to install all the gems to 1.9.3, but then I mix all gems together, maybe nicer to use gemset.
