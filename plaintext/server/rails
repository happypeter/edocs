## get it running on ubuntu 9.10

    sudo apt-get install rails # sqlite irb and anything installed as deps
    rails new myapp
    cd myapp
    rails script/server # not `rails server`

now point firefox at http://localhost:3000/
it worked

## docs
#
you actually get a README in `myapp/`
and you run:

    rake doc:guides

you get nice html docs in `doc/`

These docs surely match the exe running.
This is important
