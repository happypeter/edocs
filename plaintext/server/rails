ERROR: when running `gem install rails`, the error was 'no file to load -- zlib', the fix is:

    sudo apt-get install zlib1g zlib1g-dev 

    cd .rvm/src/ruby-1.9.2-p180/ext/zlib

    ruby extconf.rb

    make

    sudo make install

everything else works perfectly well.

NOTE: rvm hates the `&&return` in .bashrc

# new app

    rails new blog -d mysql
    rake doc:guides # need a burdle install here

then I followed the doc, and everything works well.

## db on 10.10-server and 10.04-desktop

    sudo apt-get install mysql-server # client and things are installed as deps
    sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin # php-cli and things are installed as deps

and now:

    root@lover:/etc/phpmyadmin# vim config.inc.php 

uncomment this line:

    $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = TRUE;

and add a link:

    peter@lover:/var/www$ ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin/

now point firefox at:

    http://happypeter.org/phpmyadmin/

you can login as root with no passwd

### connect mysql to rails

    sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient16 libmysqlclient16-dev

is needed for:

    sudo gem install mysql

in turn is needed to:

    rake db:create
    rake db:migrate 
## docs
#
you actually get a README in `myapp/`
and you run:

    rake doc:guides

you get nice html docs in `doc/`

These docs surely match the exe running.
This is important

## apache

    sudo gem install passenger
    sudo passenger-install-apache2-module 
    sudo vim /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

and you difinitely need:

    peter@peter-Vostro:~/xxx/blog$ rake RAILS_ENV=production db:create
    (in /home/peter/xxx/blog)
    peter@peter-Vostro:~/xxx/blog$ rake RAILS_ENV=production db:migrate

now firefox www.whatever_in_etchosts_for_localhost.com works, but phpmyadmin no longer works
