## db on 10.10-server and 10.04-desktop

    sudo apt-get install mysql-server # client and things are installed as deps
    sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin # php-cli and things are installed as deps

### finally 

    root@lover:/etc/phpmyadmin# vim config.inc.php 

uncomment this line:

    $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = TRUE;

and add a link:

    peter@lover:/var/www$ ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin/

now point firefox at:

    http://happypeter.org/phpmyadmin/

you can login as root with no passwd

## get it running on ubuntu 9.10

    sudo apt-get install rails # sqlite irb and anything installed as deps
    rails new myapp
    cd myapp
    rails script/server # not `rails server`

now point firefox at http://localhost:3000/
it worked

## docs
#
you actually get a README in `myapp/`
and you run:

    rake doc:guides

you get nice html docs in `doc/`

These docs surely match the exe running.
This is important
