NOTE: when running `rvm install 1.9.2`, now ruby is installed of course, but also rubygems, which is great. Strange here is this, you often need to Ctrl-C, when the installation starts, then it won't exit and it will use another protocal to install so that things go really fast.

use:

    gem install rails -v 3.0.7

since 3.0.7 is the verion in use on lover


## gem issue

ERROR: when running `gem install rails`, the error was 'no file to load -- zlib', the fix is:

    sudo apt-get install zlib1g zlib1g-dev 

    cd .rvm/src/ruby-1.9.2-p180/ext/zlib

    ruby extconf.rb

    make

    sudo make install

everything else works perfectly well.

NOTE: similar problem also happens to __openssl__ and __libreadline__,fixes go here:

ERROR:

    in `block in replace_bin_path': can't find executable rails 

FIX:

    gem install rails

just do this again, and things back to normal

ERROR:

    ler::ExtensionBuildError)

            /home/peter/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p290/bin/ruby extconf.rb 
            checking for rb_thread_blocking_region()... yes
            checking for mysql_query() in -lmysqlclient... no

FIX:

    sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

## change .bashrc for rvm
NOTE: rvm hates the `&&return` in .bashrc

## rake issue 
Error looks:

    'task' undefined

or:

    rails rake problems: uninitialized constant Rake::DSL 


this is a reported bug for rake 0.9, I fix this by downgrade it to 0.8.7

add this in to Gemfile:

    gem 'rake', '0.8.7'

and then `bundle update`, like suggested here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5287121/undefined-method-task-using-rake-0-9-0/5290331#5290331

and then run this:

    gem uninstall rake -v 0.9.0


and this link is useful when you have to use 0.9:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6085610/rails-rake-problems-uninitialized-constant-rakedsl


## reboot

after reboot `ruby` and `bundle` are both not found, the fix is easy:

    rvm use 1.9.2 # rvm 1.9.2 --default

and rake is now 0.9 again, fix:
    
    gem uninstall rake -v 0.9
    gem install rake -v 0.8.7

    


# new app

    rails new blog -d mysql
    rake doc:guides # need a burdle install here

then I followed the doc, and everything works well.

## db on 10.10-server and 10.04-desktop

    sudo apt-get install mysql-server # client and things are installed as deps
    sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin # php-cli and things are installed as deps

and now:

    root@lover:/etc/phpmyadmin# vim config.inc.php 

uncomment this line:

    $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = TRUE;

and add a link:

    peter@lover:/var/www$ ln -s /usr/share/phpmyadmin/

now point firefox at:

    http://happypeter.org/phpmyadmin/

you can login as root with no passwd

### connect mysql to rails

    sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient16 libmysqlclient16-dev

is needed for:

    sudo gem install mysql

in turn is needed to:

    rake db:create
    rake db:migrate 
## docs
#
you actually get a README in `myapp/`
and you run:

    rake doc:guides

you get nice html docs in `doc/`

These docs surely match the exe running.
This is important

## apache

    sudo gem install passenger
    # when dploying on lover, this step failed, so I add passenger to Gemfile,
    # and bundle update passenger, did the job, nice
    sudo passenger-install-apache2-module 
    sudo vim /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

and you difinitely need:

    peter@peter-Vostro:~/xxx/blog$ rake RAILS_ENV=production db:create
    (in /home/peter/xxx/blog)
    peter@peter-Vostro:~/xxx/blog$ rake RAILS_ENV=production db:migrate

now firefox www.whatever_in_etchosts_for_localhost.com works, but phpmyadmin no longer works
## Railscasts deployment

ERROR: Could not find eventmachine-0.12.10 in any of the sources


FIX:
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev g++ mysql-server  libmysqlclient-dev

ERROR: rake db:migrate failed

FIX: 

    iii sphinxsearch

    https://github.com/ryanb/railscasts/wiki/Deployment

now I check condif/database.yml, and now I know if u use development environment, mysql sock will be in /tmp/, but now in my mysql database, I have railscasts_production, so I know this will do:

    rake RAILS_ENV=production db:migrate

now all the tables in database: railscasts_production are successfully created.

but when I start rails server with:

    rails s

still in the browser I see the same error: can not connect .../tmp/sock.sql

and now I know I need to passenger and try to set all my env to: production.

    gem install passenger
    passenger-install-apache2-module # no sudo for both, but `cd railscasts/` is a must

    sudo vim /etc/apache2/http.conf

and add:

    LoadModule passenger_module /home/peter/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180@railscasts/gems/passenger-3.0.7/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
    PassengerRoot /home/peter/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180@railscasts/gems/passenger-3.0.7
    PassengerRuby /home/peter/.rvm/wrappers/ruby-1.9.2-p180@railscasts/ruby
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName www.lll.com
        DocumentRoot /home/peter/railscasts/public/
        RackEnv development
        <Directory /home/peter/railscasts/public>
           AllowOverride all
           Options -MultiViews
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

the line "  RackEnv development" is necessary
now:

    sudo apachectl graceful

and now point firefox at 192.168.1.103(the ip of the very VM), works.

and now I go to add a feedback msg in the brower, and the msg goes to mysql without any error.

# linode

#DNS
nice doc: http://library.linode.com/dns-guides/introduction-to-dns

gotoz:
https://secure.domain.com/account/am/mydomains.php
click "happycasts.net" -> name servers -> click "update name server" -> now

http://library.linode.com/dns-guides/configuring-dns-with-the-linode-manager

add 

    ns1.linode.com
    ns2.linode.com
    ns3.linode.com
 
as the name server used by domain.com, so now when I visit "happycasts.net" it will go to domain.com, then domain.com will use the linode.com name server, thus all the records about DNS records are done on linode.com

add media.happycasts.net as a new A record, then I go for it in firefox at once, when firefox showed me a "address not found" page, I need to wait for some time obvious. but even a quarter hour passed, and the media.happycasts.net already works in safari, firefox still gives me the "not found" page.


# rvm command

follow the output

    adduser root rvm

then I need to install gcc:

    apt-get install gcc make
    
now install ruby

    rvm install 1.9.3
    rvm use 1.9.3 # without this, `ruby --version` shows me  ruby is not installed
    rvm --default use 1.9.3

now this error:

    root@li400-112:~# gem install rails
    ERROR:  Loading command: install (LoadError)
    cannot load such file -- zlib
    ERROR:  While executing gem ... (NameError)
    uninitialized constant Gem::Commands::InstallCommand

the fix is a old method( but that the ~/.rvm is now /usr/local/rvm, since the user is now root)

    sudo apt-get install zlib1g zlib1g-dev
    cd .rvm/src/ruby-1.9.2-p180/ext/zlib
    ruby extconf.rb
    make
    sudo make install

now

    gem install rails # I got 3.2.1 installed
    gem unintall rails
    gem install rails -v 3.0.7 # on lover verion

when Installing passenger

    openssl problem can not be fixed by the hint of passenger output only, need to plus this

        cd /usr/local/rvm/ruby-1.9.3/src/ext/openssl/
        ruby extconf.rb
        make
        sudo make install

when I run
        
    bundle

then I found I need to

    apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev

when passenger is ready, and I put happycasts/ in /root/
then I see "permission denied" in the brower, which is fixed when I `mv happycasts /var/www`

linode server login as root, but I want to login as peter as before, so I

    useradd peter #create a peter
    usermod -a -G admin peter # add peter as a sudoer

 now passenger again

    gem install passenger
    passenger-install-apache2-module 
    # no sudo above!!1
    sudo vim /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

and in http.conf

    Railenv production 

cause a "we are sorry..." error page, when changed to development, it is ok then.
now everthing works as before. So all the "cancan can not checkout " problem is gone when I no longer login with root
