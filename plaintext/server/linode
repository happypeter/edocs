# delete linode_us
the ping result( 90ms -> 430ms), my linode_us is much slower(5 times) then linode_tokyo
So i deleted it(IP: 50.116.39.108)
and now have a new linode_tyko vps( ssh root@106.186.19.191)
# Step ssh freezing

    KeepAlive yes
    ClientAliveInterval 60

add above to sever's `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

   sudo service ssh restart

It's nice to use "gnu screen" to keep the session alive on server


# add a new user on linode machine
by default the new linode machine only has a root user ( with a password )
so how can I add a user ( e.g peter ), and add it as suders

1. create the user

    useradd peter

2. check `/ect/sudoers` then I know all users in `admin` group has the right to `sudo`
   so create the group

    $ addgroup admin

3. finally add the user ( peter ) to the group ( admin )
   
    $ usermod -g admin peter
    CHECK ALSO: $useradd peter --ingroup admin

4. done

1. port 22/ssh is blocked by GFW, but http is ok
