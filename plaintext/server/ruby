# nil? blank? empty?

from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/885414/a-concise-explanation-of-nil-v-empty-v-blank-in-ruby-on-rails

    .nil?

    can be used on any object and is true if the object is nil

    .empty?

    can be used on strings, arrays and hashes and returns true if:

    String length == 0
    Array length == 0
    Hash length == 0
    running .empty? on something that is nil will throw a NoMethodError

    That is where .blank? comes in. It is implemented by Rails and will operate on any object as well as work like .empty? on strings, arrays and hashes.

    nil.blank? == true
    [].blank? == true
    {}.blank? == true
    "".blank? == true
    5.blank? == false

so .nil? is for object
   .empty? is for s, a, h
   .blank? is a rails extention not part of ruby
