## revover MBR (mbr) with liveCD
this is useful when you install windows after your ubuntu installation, or simply your mbr is messed up for any reason:

    1. boot from liveCD
    2. mount your partition where your earlier /boot/grub is
    3. sudo grub-install --root-directroy=/media/uuid-of-the partition /dev/sda( do not use sda6, even your /boot is on sda6)
    4. that's all.

 * check dev/
     

    $cd /dev
    $ls s-

## partitions

now I want to enlarge my /home(mounted /dev/sda6), 

    parted -l

then 

    parted -m

and within its prompt

    resize 6 50GB   100GB

it seems that it will work, but I do not know how to unmount /home

    (parted) mkpart logical ext4 100.5GB 150GB

it worked and I get this

     7      100GB   150GB   49.5GB  logical

when I run parted -l, and a sda7 inside /dev/

    root@peter-work:~# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda7
    root@peter-work:~# mount /dev/sda7 /home/peter/sda7/ -t ext4

now I just need to figure out how root give this partition to peter ?

## the real solution

just insert 10.04 disk reboot and enter installation process, do manual
partition and resize your home partion to whatever size you want, do not
`format` it, mount it again on `/home`, then quit the installation, done! No
data is corruptd after reboot.
