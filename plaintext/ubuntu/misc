## add a user

    adduser billie # this is the front-end to useradd, who won't care about passwd and homedir, so adduser is preferred 
    usermod -g admin billie # add billie to admin group, so sudo granted


## set IP 

In taiyuan, Linux machine had some problem to get DNS server address, 
what I did was:

    system->preference->network connection

and then copy everything  you see in windows connection into the popup here.
## keyring problem in ubuntu 10.10

    system->preference->passwds and encrpt keyrings

delete `defualt` by right clicking on it
reboot the system, and try to connect to wireless network
then you'll be asked for new passwd for the keyring, leave it empty
and you're done

## sudo without pswd
     

     pet@girl:~$ sudo visudoer  #"vim /etc/sudoers" is dangerous
     

  now add one line
     

     pet ALL=(ALL)NOPASSWD: ALL
     

 now I can "sudo -i" without typing password

## Format disk 
 * check dev/
     

    $cd /dev
    $ls s-
     


 * plug mp3
     

    $ls s-
     

now i see a sdb is added here
 * umount
     
 
     umount /media/disk-1         //not always disk-1
     


 * then
     
 
     mkfs.vfat -I /dev/sdb
     

## partitions

now I want to enlarge my /home(mounted /dev/sda6), 

    parted -l

then 

    parted -m

and within its prompt

    resize 6 50GB   100GB

it seems that it will work, but I do not know how to unmount /home

    (parted) mkpart logical ext4 100.5GB 150GB

it worked and I get this

     7      100GB   150GB   49.5GB  logical

when I run parted -l, and a sda7 inside /dev/

    root@peter-work:~# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda7
    root@peter-work:~# mount /dev/sda7 /home/peter/sda7/ -t ext4

now I just need to figure out how root give this partition to peter ?

## the real solution

just insert 10.04 disk reboot and enter installation process, do manual
partition and resize your home partion to whatever size you want, do not
`format` it, mount it again on `/home`, then quit the installation, done! No
data is corruptd after reboot.
