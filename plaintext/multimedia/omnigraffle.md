## insert pics

file -> Plave image

if you use background image, do not expect the whole background can be
exported.

## steps:

Convas Size -> 1024 px 768 px
view -> uncheck "page break"
When you export, need to use "bitmap resolution 72 dots per inch" to really
get a 1024pxx78px png file
Strange my version of showoff can not handle the 1024x768px(the scott's size)
properly, so maybe I can scale it by 90%
