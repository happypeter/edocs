Now how to get my youtube video

 * audactivy
 * kino->export a dv file, or export it as avi file for youtube.
     
   NOTE: kino can also export the file.flv formats, or for some reason, the sound lost.
 * And now you may use

      ''$ffmepg ''

  to covert the .dv file into .avi or .flv file, then youtube accept both, but still there is no sound in the .flv file
 * when the file is finally up loaded, you wll find it in happypeter1983->my Video 

And you can also do the follows to youtube

 * www.savevid.com   save youtube videos in mp4 format
 * /tmp/   wait her when you finish downloading a youtube video then use
      then change the name into xxx.flv 
## ssh

 ssh -N -D 1080 test009@ss9.he9.org

NOTE: when I typed in the passwd: test009, there was no prompted info telling me connection established or sth
but I know I've been doing right, since I am now using the serverIP(check by http://whatismyip.com/), besides, if
the right passwd is not given, there will be a error msg anyway. 

firefox->edit->preference->advanced->network->settings

socks: 127.0.0.1 PORT: 1080
socks v5

NOW> set parser, go firefox, and type in the adress bar: about:config

set `network.proxy.socks_remote_dns` to `true`
NOTE: if this is false(as it was defaulted), I can open youtube page and even login
but I get "connection timeout" whenever I an trying to view the video/
