Now how to get my youtube video

 * audactivy
 * kino->export a dv file, or export it as avi file for youtube.
     
   NOTE: kino can also export the file.flv formats, or for some reason, the sound lost.
 * And now you may use

      ''$ffmepg ''

  to covert the .dv file into .avi or .flv file, then youtube accept both, but still there is no sound in the .flv file
 * when the file is finally up loaded, you wll find it in happypeter1983->my Video 

And you can also do the follows to youtube

 * www.savevid.com   save youtube videos in mp4 format
 * /tmp/   wait her when you finish downloading a youtube video then use
      then change the name into xxx.flv 
## ssh firewall

 ssh -N -D 1080 test009@ss9.he9.org

NOTE: when I typed in the passwd: test009, there was no prompted info telling me connection established or sth
but I know I've been doing right, since I am now using the serverIP(check by http://whatismyip.com/), besides, if
the right passwd is not given, there will be a error msg anyway. 

firefox->edit->preference->advanced->network->settings

socks: 127.0.0.1 PORT: 1080
socks v5

NOW> set parser, go firefox, and type in the adress bar: about:config

set `network.proxy.socks_remote_dns` to `true`
NOTE: if this is false(as it was defaulted), I can open youtube page and even login
but I get "connection timeout" whenever I an trying to view the video/

Edit: when I did a firefox upgrade, things stop working, it is finally solved by changing

    network.proxy.socks_port    (change the "value" from 1080 to 7070, as given in the "ssh -D..." command)

A BETTER WAY:

use a firefox addon named Autoproxy

Proxy rules -> Add rule subscription -> check "gfwList" then subscribe ->done

and now:

Proxy server -> Edit Proxyserver -> "ssh -D 127.0.0.1 7070  socks5"( this is usually the default, so nothing to do here)

and now:

 ssh -N -D 7070 test009@ss9.he9.org

finally:

Proxy server -> choose Proxyserver -> change whaterver to "ssh -D"

now it works for both Mac and ubuntu
