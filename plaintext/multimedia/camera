I am trying to use my black dell camera, I see on a video that people is using

peter@bull:~$ sudo apt-get install camorama

to record her own image

but when I start my own camorama, the error is :

	could not connect to video device (/dev/video0)

## check info

	2010  sudo apt-get install v4l-conf
	v4l-info

and I see all seems alright, like

	name                    : "Integrated_Webcam_2M"

besides, people say if the /dev/video0 is there, that means the device is plugged in.
and I believe the driver must be installed already.

## solution

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/camorama/+bug/81838

the link told me now I need to use *cheese*, camorama is deprecated.

and cheese just works, no futher configration is required.

sound recored too.
