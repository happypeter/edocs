## ubuntu key display
key-mon - Project Hosting on Google Code

screenkey does not work on 9.10

but one 10.04, you just need to install python-xlib, and then download
screenkey deb and then install it, it works.

## ogv -> mov

now I can record video on ubuntu as ogv files, then cp them to mac,
VLC to play them and screenflow to record them into mov. 
Sounds dirty, but works really nice
