rails can use one _form partial for both "new"(creat) and "edit"(update)
that's becasue `form_for(@item)`, can actually detect if the @item is empty or not, then set method to POST or PUT depending on that when rendering the form html for us
Very smart!

PUT the form -> update
POST the form -> create
