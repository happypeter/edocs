## indent

`set autoindent` is nice, and I added it to my .vimrc
`set noautoindent|paste` is needed, when paste stuff
`3>>` to indent the following 3 lines

## function folding

1.	use `z+f+%` to fold all the functions in a big file
2.	then `z+x` only eXtract the one you want to view, others will be folded again
3.	it is nice.
4.	use `zj` or `zk` to move among folds, and then `zx` to view, quit good.

## move a text block to another file

1.	move cursor to the beginning of this block and press `v`
2.	`j` to move upwards, or `k` the other way
// can also use `yn` or `yG`, `y$`... much faster
3.	`d` to kill the selected block(or `y` to copy)
4.	`vnew filename` to open a new window
5.	`^Wv` to do the same but no filename for the new buffer
6.	 I can `ma` to set mark and `d'a` to kill
## buffer

1.	`:ls` to list out all bufffers
2.	`:buffer 1` to go to buffer NO.1

## find usage
move cursor to the word, do `[I`
## compile-run-debug
