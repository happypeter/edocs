Now what if I want to add a new file?

   1. goto nerdtree window, move cursor to *edocs/plaintext/vi*(or any files
underneath), then *cd* to set CWD to *vi/*

   2. now I can use *vnew filename* to add a new file in the current dir *vi/*
 
   3. you can use *A* to maximize the nerdtree window
   4. and ":!git ci" works nice here
