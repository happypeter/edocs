I think my day-to-day doc can grow this way:

1.	first we have one file named wiki
2.	when we have too many topics in wiki, we make it a dir
3.	and divide some big topics in to echo own file
4.	when the same happens to one of these files, we make it a dir as well
5.	just keep going this way, my doc actually grow like a tree.

so we can 

1.	use markdown format, because muse is too complex, and we must have a format
2.	so we have folders and subfolders, we will generate them into index pages
3.	anyway just let things grow organically.
4.	so we can covert all the markdown files into htmls, though they are not interconnected, but things are clear in a TREE way

wow, this is really cool, as natural as nature.
