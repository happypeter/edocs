# evolution
is just like outlook

the nice thing to  have it is that I can bind my gmail account to it
, using it as a email client

configed according to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingGmailWithEvolution
now I can click on a email-address on webpages and send email directly

##

but maybe light weight command line tools like fetchmail and sendmail are better for me

PROBLEM: Recently accessing to Gmail become a nightmare, so I want a fetchmail to get the mails for me when the network is OK, and I do not want to send mail by gmail, but by  msmtp on my own machine. And of cuourse a textual mail reader is nicer than GUI, so mutt!

## use mutt as a simple gmail client

cat ~/.muttrc

    set imap_user = "happypeter1983@gmail.com"
    set imap_pass = "03175987345"

    set smtp_url = "smtp://happypeter1983@smtp.gmail.com:587/"
    set smtp_pass = "03175987345"
    set from = "happypeter1983@gmail.com"
    set realname = "peter wang"

    set folder = "imaps://imap.gmail.com:993"
    set spoolfile = "+INBOX"
    set postponed="+[Gmail]/Drafts"

    set header_cache=~/.mutt/cache/headers
    set message_cachedir=~/.mutt/cache/bodies
    set certificate_file=~/.mutt/certificates

    set move = no

## the real monster

Q: what happened when I see `fetchmail -v` worked well, while in mutt I saw `no mailbox`?

A: there is this in .muttrc

        # If not set in ~/.bashrc:
        set spoolfile = /var/spool/mail/peter

   but for some reason fetchmail save all mail in /var/mail/peter(peter is a file not dir)

        peter@vostro:/var/spool$ sudo ln -s ../mail/

problem solved


#sendmail
