# use Autoproxy

https://addons.mozilla.org
add  Autoproxy

Proxy rules -> Add rule subscription -> check "gfwList" then subscribe ->done

and now:

    Proxy server -> Edit Proxyserver -> "ssh -D 127.0.0.1 7070  socks5"( this is usually the default, so nothing to do here)

and now:

 ssh -N -D 7070 test009@s2.he9.org

finally:

Proxy server -> choose Proxyserver -> change whaterver to "ssh -D" (when not matching "no proxy" is MUST)

now it works for both Mac and ubuntu (ubuntu has a BROKEN sshpass package, so need to get the source from sf.net)

you want to use twitter: change the server from s2  to s3, dirty!!!

## add new site to gfwList

firefox -> preference -> advanced -> network settings -> Add proxy rule( if you have Autoproxy installed by now)
   Add New Rule -> press Enter(do not use Esc or anything) -> click "apply" -> click "OK"
then we are good.

## trap

networking->setting->proxy server-> choose proxy server
when the rule is not matched(say, you visit baidu.com), set it "Don't use proxy", otherwise, sites like baidu or youku is blocked when u are using autoproxy



# OBSOLETED (since autoproxy does everything for me, every setting below
# does not matter at all)

 ssh -N -D 1080 test009@ss9.he9.org

NOTE: when I typed in the passwd: test009, there was no prompted info telling me connection established or sth
but I know I've been doing right, since I am now using the serverIP(check by http://whatismyip.com/), besides, if
the right passwd is not given, there will be a error msg anyway. 

firefox->edit->preference->advanced->network->settings-> manually proxy conf


socks: 127.0.0.1 PORT: 1080  #these can also be set in about:config
socks v5

NOW> set parser, go firefox, and type in the adress bar: about:config

set `network.proxy.socks_remote_dns` to `true`

NOTE: if this is false(as it was defaulted), I can open youtube page and even login
but I get "connection timeout" whenever I an trying to view the video/

Edit: when I did a firefox upgrade, things stop working, it is finally solved by changing

    network.proxy.socks_port    (change the "value" from 1080 to 7070, as given in the "ssh -D..." command)
