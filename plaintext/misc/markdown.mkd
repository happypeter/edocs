the author says
**github** 
support markdown syntax by default, so this is a test

now it works, so a file extention *.mkd* is a MUST


Markdown merits:

1.	 easier to write than muse

since now I give up using emacs, at least temperaryly, so I will switch form 
muse to markdown.

2. be highly readable in source format
