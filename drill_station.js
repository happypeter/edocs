  /**
   * - solution: 
   *   - drawers r really good place to hold screws https://youtu.be/wy432QudAWE?t=132
   *   - thigh level shallow drawers r really handy, I will have more when I build my new assembly_table
   *   // - https://shop.familyhandyman.com/collections/garage/products/hardware-organizer
   * - rule of thumb:
   *   - the storage box top needs to be open all the time, so that when I am returning some excess screws, I don't need to pull a small drawer or move box stacked on top of the one I want, lame.
   *   - I won't take the storage boxes to my job site, I will use another box to hold just about the number I need, so that I don't have to return the box once I am done imediately
   *   - for screws i don't use that often, just keep them in it's original paper boxes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glS_ESlltlI
   * - my workflow
   *   - I think strorage should be dictated by my workflow
   *   - NO.1 I need to take some screws to job site in a hurry, that means, I need to access the screws easily
   *   - NO.2 more often than not, I left some screws over, then I need to put them back to each of their own box, very quickly
   *   - simply put, fecth quick, and put quick. that's way people use the 
   *   - the conculsion, mostly often used screws need to state on a shelf that's at the best height to acess
   *     - the top of the boxes need to be ALWAYS widely open, stacking them on top each other is a bug of my current system. and small drawers also not good enough for me, yeah, just shallow shelf to hold the boxes, that's it.
   *     - for those that I dont use that often, I will keep them in it's own package box(like The Honest Carpenter https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glS_ESlltlI), or small stackble plastic boxes, and store them in cabinet or drawers. and sort them properly, so they are not too far from reach
