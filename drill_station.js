   * boxes in cabinets is the way to go, sth like https://youtu.be/j-jVst7CEMw?t=5
   * - a shallow shelfing unit on french cleat, like https://youtu.be/VxnDDY7au7k?t=360
   *   - have many 15x15x10 boxes as small drawers
   *   - stacking boxes on top of each other is not convinnent enough 
   * - requirements
   *   - heavy: I don't want the box be blown away when I work outside
   *   - for many screws, just keep them in it's original paper boxes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glS_ESlltlI
   * - my workflow
   *   - I think strorage should be dictated by my workflow
   *   - NO.1 I need to take some screws to job site in a hurry, that means, I need to access the screws easily
   *   - NO.2 more often than not, I left some screws over, then I need to put them back to each of their own box, very quickly
   *   - simply put, fecth quick, and put quick. that's way people use the 
   *   - the conculsion, mostly often used screws need to state on a shelf that's at the best height to acess
   *     - the top of the boxes need to be ALWAYS widely open, stacking them on top each other is a bug of my current system. and small drawers also not good enough for me, yeah, just shallow shelf to hold the boxes, that's it.
   *     - for those that I dont use that often, I will keep them in it's own package box(like The Honest Carpenter https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glS_ESlltlI), or small stackble plastic boxes, and store them in cabinet or drawers. and sort them properly, so they are not too far from reach
