/**
 * - upper cabinets instead of tool walls
 *   - I am giving up tool walls, my upper cabinets are much more efficent use of space
 *   - simple cabinets without doors are much easier reorganizable than the speacail tool wall hangers
 * - for long things, like lumbers, clamps
 *   - leave the corners of rooms without installing upper cabinets for clamps
 *   - store lumbers on top of multiple upper cabinets
 * - working space vs storage space
 *   - most easily accessible spaces, e.g bench top, low upper cabinet tier, top drawers, will be kept empty
 *     - when I have a project, these places will be my working space to put my tools
 *     - once the project is done, tools go back to their own home in storage space
 *     - I will still keep a bit tool wall space, for tools I use for almost every project
 * - fully utilize the space above the upper cabinets top 
 * - don't go too fancy
 *   - don't expose everything, I will still follow my 'shelf box' philo, and most things should stay in a box
 * - drawers
  * - shallow drawers
  *   - toolbox style drawers, and maybe some vertical drawers too
  *   - https://youtu.be/jtdmzpHixnU?t=43
  * - as many drawers as I can for base cabinets
   - lable everything
     - give every shelf/cabinet/workbench a name, give every shelf and drawer a serial number
     - even a tmp cardboard box should have a name, to show what's inside, and be easily searchable on my laptop
   - cleats every where
     - like https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV11W411o7Kg/?t=3
     - so that I can hang tools close to my work site
   - ITERATE ALWAYS
     - cabinets is not for everything, use simple wall-hung shelves when proper

       - cabinet vs simpleShelving
         - cabinets are very easy to build, super stable, much more extensible than simpleShelving
         - I can utilize cabinet sides to hold things, I can use two cabinets as brackets to carry shelves on top
         - I can even install flip side refridgerator doors on cabinet
         - simple shelves are not actully that easy to make stable and strong
         - conclution: I highly pro cabinets now
     - OSB on the walls, franch cleat, shelves, cabinets, are all easy now, do whatever that make sense
     - on the floor, build large carcass as work table support, and add drawers when needed
  - same Level tabletops
    - all work tables benches cabinet tops, machine work surface, should be on the same level
    - standing table: 90cm
    - sitting table: 70cm
    - cabinet lumber carrying top: 200cm
    - you will thank yourself when you work with large wood pieces https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1hb4y1e7Da/?t=5m50s
  - indoor work tables
    - will be supported by two base cabinets(60highx50widex60deep*2, or 60highx50x30deep)
    - outdoor tables will be on legs, indoors are all on cabinets
    - 3 drawers on on cabinets, that makes each one less than 20cm tall
      - that is good, if tall things will stay in cabinet_spaces
    - 2 cabinet_space for each cabinet for the stroage of tall things
      - have sliding_trays if necessary
