/**
 * - upper cabinets instead of tool walls
 *   - I am giving up tool walls, my upper cabinets are much more efficent use of space
 *   - simple cabinets without doors are much easier reorganizable than the speacail tool wall hangers
 * - for long things, like lumbers, clamps
 *   - leave the corners of rooms without installing upper cabinets for clamps
 *   - store lumbers on top of multiple upper cabinets
 * - working space vs storage space
 *   - most easily accessible spaces, e.g bench top, low upper cabinet tier, top drawers, will be kept empty
 *     - when I have a project, these places will be my working space to put my tools
 *     - once the project is done, tools go back to their own home in storage space
 *     - I will still keep a bit tool wall space, for tools I use for almost every project
 * - fully utilize the space above the upper cabinets top 
 * - don't go too fancy
 *   - don't expose everything, I will still follow my 'shelf box' philo, and most things should stay in a box
 * - drawers
  * - shallow drawers
  *   - toolbox style drawers, and maybe some vertical drawers too
  *   - https://youtu.be/jtdmzpHixnU?t=43
  * - as many drawers as I can for base cabinets
   - lable everything
     - give every shelf/cabinet/workbench a name, give every shelf and drawer a serial number
     - even a tmp cardboard box should have a name, to show what's inside, and be easily searchable on my laptop
   - cleats every where
     - like https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV11W411o7Kg/?t=3
     - so that I can hang tools close to my work site
   - ITERATE ALWAYS
     - cabinets is not for everything, use simple wall-hung shelves when proper
       - https://youtu.be/B7PTmKugR-s?t=389
     - OSB on the walls, franch cleat, shelves, cabinets, are all easy now, do whatever that make sense
     - on the floor, build large carcass as work table support, and add drawers when needed
