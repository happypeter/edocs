/**
 * - upper cabinets instead of tool walls
 *   - I am giving up tool walls, my upper cabinets are much more efficent use of space
 *   - simple cabinets without doors are much easier reorganizable than the speacail tool wall hangers
 * - for long things, like lumbers, clamps
 *   - leave the corners of rooms without installing upper cabinets for clamps
 *   - store lumbers on top of multiple upper cabinets
 * - work space vs storage space
 *   - everything should have it's home, based on how often they are used, the home could either be in
 *     - work space: easy to access areas
 *       - things used less than once a week, will mostly go stroage space
 *       - even for things kept in work space, based on usage frequency, they will be put in diffent locations
 *     - storage spaces: top of cabinet, carport, gate shed...
 *     - e.g If I bought 1000 4mm long tiny screws
 *       - 950 of them should be backup, and be put in a storage space
 *       - the other 50 will be kept in a work space
 *         - if(often used), they will be kept in a small box of its own
 *         - else, they will be mixed with other sizes
 * - fully utilize the space above the upper cabinets top 
 * - don't go too fancy
 *   - don't expose everything, I will still follow my 'shelf box' philo, and most things should stay in a box
 * - drawers
  * - shallow drawers
  *   - toolbox style drawers, and maybe some vertical drawers too
  *   - https://youtu.be/jtdmzpHixnU?t=43
  * - as many drawers as I can for base cabinets
   - lable everything
     - give every shelf/cabinet/workbench a name, give every shelf and drawer a serial number
     - even a tmp cardboard box should have a name, to show what's inside, and be easily searchable on my laptop
   - cleats every where
     - like https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV11W411o7Kg/?t=3
     - so that I can hang tools close to my work site
   - hirachy
     - go everything.js
  - indoor work tables
    - will be supported by two base cabinets(60highx50widex60deep*2, or 60highx50x30deep)
    - outdoor tables will be on legs, indoors are all on cabinets
    - 3 drawers on on cabinets, that makes each one less than 20cm tall
      - that is good, if tall things will stay in cabinet_spaces
    - 2 cabinet_space for each cabinet for the stroage of tall things
      - have sliding_trays if necessary
