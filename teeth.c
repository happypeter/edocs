  /*
  - wisdom teeth suck, because it ruins the teeth next tho them.
  - in my case the gap between my upper left wisdom and the next tooth 
    also has food in it, so both decay.
  - I removed it today(20220616), it is 50% empty, and food inside it stinks to heaven.
    - I remeber this smell, since everytime I finish my 板面 noodles, I suck
      my mouth water a bit, I can taste the smell.
    - I had the first serious pain here, two years ago. should've removed it then
      - for the past two years, the gap has always been annoying, since food stuck in there quit ofen
      - every a month or so, If I eat a lot meat, eapecial beef, I felt the pain
        - before today, I've always believed the beef changed my blood, and my blood
          caused the local pain there. Now I see the decay, I know it's the fermentation of the food stuck there caused the pain
